There is limited data on bimodal stimulation in elderly patients.
We compare the outcome of bimodal stimulation and analyzed the correlation of bimodal benefit and residual hearing in elderly patients.
Most elderly patients benefit from bimodal stimulation.
In quiet and in comparison with CI alone, most patients showed some improvement in word recognition scores using bimodal fitting, and all of them were using the contralateral hearing aid all day long.
In July 2012 a revised terminology on colposcopic examinations of the cervix uteri was adopted by IFCPC.
Central aspect is a description of characteristics that should aid in the definition of the disease entity cervix uteri.
The nomenclature is built up in such a way that the examiner can evaluate colposcopic criteria according to a specific scheme.
Firstly it is assessed whether the colposcopy is representative.
Then it should be clarified whether or not the findings are normal.
If the findings are not normal but rather abnormal the severity of the lesion is classified according to the so-called grade 1 (minor change) and grade 2 findings (major change).
Specific abnormal findings such as leukoplakia, erosion and Lugol's finding are also not defined at this point.
Characteristics suspicious for an invasion are described separately, in particular, atypical vessel patterns are mentioned here.
As already held in the previous revised nomenclature (Barcelona), various findings are described in a last group: congenital transformation zones (CTZ), congenital anomalies, condylomas (papillomas), endometriosis, polyps (ectocervical, endocervical), inflammation, stenosis, postoperative changes (scarred portio, vaginal stump).
Diagnostics, etiology and therapeutic options are discussed.
The implementation strategies were assigned by chance to 10 rehabilitation clinics. Expenditure of time was evaluated by questionnaire.
Additionally materials and travel expenses were calculated.
The higher total implementation costs can basically be attributed to higher personnel costs due to the time-consuming seminar.
Bladder cancer is the second most common urological malignant disease.
There are various treatment strategies which, depending on tumor stage and grade, can minimize recurrence and lower progression rate.
The article starts with the first publication presenting thermochemotherapy with Mitomycin C using the Synergo device and highlights the first randomized controlled study comparing Mitomycin C (Synergo
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (FDG-PET-CT) exhibits high diagnostic accuracy in the detection of vascular graft infections.
Therapy control in vascular graft infection with FDG-PET-CT appears to be useful, as a significant impact on patient management has been described; however, supplemental data from large outcome studies are still pending.
Urinary bladder injury or malfunction may occur due to a variety of underlying diseases or trauma mechanisms.
This review discusses surgical principles and approaches for urinary bladder reconstruction and function preservation.
Suburethral tension-free vaginal tape is used for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence with a high success rate.
Often patients report having stress incontinence, as well as co-existing micturition problems which are attributable to overactive bladder syndrome (OAB).
The present study examines the effect of suburethral tape on the symptoms of OAB.
In the study, we used the transobturator vaginal tape inside-out technique (TVT-O).
A 52 year old Swiss presented with a sore throat and progressive hoarseness.
The histology showed a granulomatous inflammation of the epiglottis.
The histoplasma antigen was positive in urine and serum.
An alternative therapy for the disseminated histoplasmosis is voriconazol.
The investigation of the travel history is an important point.
In the German Health system there is an increasing competition in the recruitment of specialised staff, especially for rehabilitation centres, which are deemed less attractive.
Therefore, this study examines the attractiveness of the field of medical rehabilitation from the point of view of medical professionals.
We conducted 16 semi-structured interviews with doctors from 7 rehabilitation centres with different medical specialisations.
The interviews were digitized and transcribed. A structured content analysis was carried out using the software MAXQDA 11.
745 codes were identified and assigned to the categories "attractiveness", "unfavourable aspects" and "special features" of rehabilitation.
Regarding medical rehabilitation, the interviewees appreciated especially the predictable, flexible working environment with little time pressure.
Among the special features of rehabilitation in comparison with acute care were the higher relevance of the bio-psycho-social model of health and illness as well as the higher proportion of communication and organisation.
Radiation induced atherosclerosis of the carotid artery is a clinically relevant late complication after head and neck radiotherapy.
We examined the cytotoxic effects of chaetocin on clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) cells and the possibility to combine the effects of chaetocin with the effects of cytokine-induced killer cells (CIK) assayed by MTT assay and FACS analysis.
Chaetocin is a thiodioxopiperazine produced by fungi belonging to the chaetomiaceae family.
In 2007, it was first reported that chaetocin shows potent and selective ex vivo anti-cancer activity by inducing reactive oxygen species.
CIK cells are generated from CD3+/CD56- T lymphocytes with double negative CD4-/CD8- phenotype that are isolated from human blood.
The results of this research state that the anti-ccRCC activity of chaetocin is weak and does not show a high grade of selectivity on clear cell renal cell carcinoma cells.
Although the CIK cells show a high grade of selective anti-ccRCC activity, this effect could not be improved by the addition of chaetocin.
So chaetocin seems to be no suitable agent for specific targeting ccRCC cells or for the combination therapy with CIK cells in renal cancer.
Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis is a rare but serious complication of solid tumors such as melanoma, breast and lung cancer, as well as gastrointestinal carcinomas.
Its clinical manifestation is highly variable, presenting as radicular pain with or without neurological deficits, as well as with headaches and hallucinatory irritation symptoms.
Here we report a rare case of a patient with BRAF-mutated microsatellite stable colon carcinoma with lymphatic and skeletal metastases, who developed neurological symptoms one month after the initial diagnosis of malignancy.
Based on the cytological detection of tumor cells in the cerebrospinal fluid, a leptomeningeal carcinomatosis was diagnosed, despite normal findings on MRI.
Intrathecal chemotherapy with methotrexate, combined with intensive systemic immunochemotherapy, resulted in a good partial remission of the underlying malignant disease.
However, approximately 8 months after the start of therapy, the patient developed progressive leptomeningeal carcinomatosis and died a few weeks later.
Consumers and patients want to be included in decisions regarding their own health and have an ethically justified claim on informed decisions.
Therefore, sound information is required, but health information is often misleading and based on different interests.
The risks of disease and the benefits of medical interventions tend to be overestimated, whereas harm is often underestimated.
Evidence-based health information has to fulfil certain criteria, for instance, it should be evidence-based, independent, complete, true as well as understandable.
The aim of a medical intervention has to be explained.
The different therapeutic options including the option not to intervene have to be delineated.
The probabilities for success, lack of success and unwanted side effects have to be communicated in a numerical and understandable manner.
Patients have the right to reject medical interventions without any sanctions.
Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disease that shows high penetrance with a wide variability in the phenotype.
The present case report describes diagnosis and therapy of unilateral gynaecomastia in a toddler showing integumental stigmata of NF1. Furthermore, the report provides a brief review of the literature concerning this finding in NF1.
The clinical picture of an acute abdomen is frequently encountered in emergency medicine.
In most cases abdominal pathologies underlie this condition, however, also extra-abdominal diseases may present or cause an acute abdomen.
The fact that this condition is potentially life-threatening highlights the importance of instant action.
Here, we report on the case of a young woman that presented with an acute abdomen in our clinic.
Imaging revealed a massively distended stomach reaching the lesser pelvis.
On the same day we performed an explorative laparotomy in which massive amounts of clotted, undigested food was recovered via a gastrotomy.
Postoperatively, upon psychiatric consultation, an eating disorder with daily eating binges could be revealed as being the cause for the acute and dramatic gastric dilatation.
The patient fully recovered from surgery and psychiatric co-treatment was initiated.
This unique case report demonstrates how a psychiatric condition may lead to an acute abdomen, however, it also emphasizes the importance of prompt diagnosis and adequate therapy to avoid complications and allowing for full recovery.
Conventional chemotherapy is generally administered in high doses followed by a treatment-free period to give the body needful time to recover.
This "maximum tolerated dose" approach results in high response rates.
However, long periods between therapy cycles can lead to development of resistance mechanisms and consequently disease progression.
One of the most interesting alternative strategies is metronomic chemotherapy.
This concept relies on the continuous administration of chemotherapy at low doses and aims at targeting endothelial cells in the tumor bed as well.
Recently, metronomic chemotherapy has been incorporated into the recommendations issued by the German AGO expert panel (www.ago-online.de).
A systematic review of PubMed/Medline, ClinicalTrials.gov, the European Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT) and the Cochrane Database was conducted.
In the present review, we discuss the current evidence on metronomic chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer.
Many children show developmental abnormalities in the first years of life.
This article presents current developmental screening methods in primary care, defines the terminology of developmental disorders in young children, demonstrates the essential diagnostic procedures in developmentally impaired children and describes the interdisciplinary collaboration between physicians, psychologists, therapists and special needs educators.
The term "pauci-immune" defines the characteristic absence of immune complexes in the tissues.
Circulating antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are of pathogenic and diagnostic relevance.
To prevent diagnostic delay practitioners should measure ANCA promptly in case of acute kidney injury with hematuria.
Patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) represent the most severe form of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and exhibit high mortality rates.
Frequently, PAD in CLI patients involves the infrapopliteal arterial segment challenging endovascular revascularization strategies.
Restenosis remains the major drawback of tibial angioplasty encountered in more than two thirds of CLI patients undergoing tibial revascularization.
Telephone consultations are part of GP's daily routine.
The patients appreciate the quick and uncomplicated access to consultations via phone and therefore the demand for telephone consultations is increasing steadily.
Nevertheless, telephone consultations pose a challenge to healthcare professionals.
Safety is improved by adhering to recommendations.
The required skills are learnable.
To develop appropriate solutions, the existing situation in Germany and selected European countries was analyzed.
Additionally, in 27 medical practitioners' offices and 14 hospitals, the true practice of reprocessing was analyzed using a questionnaire, a checklist, and inspection on site.
A structured analysis of potential alternatives to the internal reprocessing was conducted within the German and European context. The results indicate that the conditions for the execution of the reprocessing process in the analyzed health facilities in southern Hesse (Germany) do not satisfy legal requirements.
The detected deficiencies were consistent with other reports from Germany and Europe.
The analysis gave insight into several reasons for the detected deficiencies.
The three main reasons were the high costs for proper implementation, the subjective value assigned to the reprocessing unit in health care facilities, and deficits in monitoring by the health authority.
Throughout the European Union, a similar regulatory framework for the performance of the reprocessing process exists, while the environment, structures of the health systems and administrative supervision vary significantly.
The German states as well as selected European countries are currently discussing the challenges of increased quality-assured execution of the reprocessing process.
For instance, the same supervisory system for hospitals and medical practitioners should be established at an equal standard.
A 10-year-old male castrated Domestic Shorthair cat was evaluated for an asymptomatic tachyarrhythmia noted two weeks prior.
Electrocardiography revealed a normal sinus rhythm with atrial premature complexes and paroxysms of supraventricular tachycardia with a heart rate between 300 and 400 min-1.
Echocardiography was unremarkable, and concentrations of circulating cardiac troponin I, T4, and blood taurine were within reference ranges.
The cat was treated with sotalol (2.1 mg/kg q12h, PO) but the arrhythmia was insufficiently controlled as determined during several re-examinations within a two-year time period.
The persistent nature of the tachyarrhythmia, the progressive structural and functional cardiac changes, and comparative gross and histopathologic post-mortem findings are consistent with the diagnosis of tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.
The Wagner as well as the Armstrong classification is used for diabetic foot ulcers.
The advantage of the Armstrong stages is that important informations like wound infection or ischemia are considered.
This paper presents the results of a survey among key informants that was conducted between June and September 2011 in Breast Cancer Centers that were accredited according to the criteria of the German Cancer Society (DKG).
The Questionnaire for Breast Cancer Centres Key Informants 2011 (FRIZ 2011) was used with two reminders having been sent out.
The vast majority of respondents indicated to be part of the Breast Cancer Center management.
Overall, the concept is regarded as "good" or "very good" by almost all respondents.
Both contact to resident doctors and the hospitals' reputations improved since the implementation of the concept.
We report the case of a 72 year old patient with B-symptoms and a persistent pulmonary infiltrate despite an antibiotic therapy.
Buds of granulation tissue were found by transbronchial biopsy proving an organizing pneumonia.
B-Symptoms and pulmonary infiltrate were improved immediately by a therapy with steroids.
Even though there were reasons for a secondary organizing pneumonia due to a known chronic lymphocytic leukemia and a pneumonia treated four months before, we consider a cryptogenic organizing pneumonia as most probable.
Surgical eyebrow lift has been described by using many different open and endoscopic methods.
Difficult techniques and only short time benefits oft lead to patients' complaints.
Besides simplicity and safety, our technique shows long lasting aesthetic results with hidden scars and a high rate of patient satisfaction.
In the era of cost increases and reduced resources in the German healthcare system, the value of health services research and health economics is increasing more and more.
Goals are the assessment of benefits and the economic advantages and disadvantages of new and established diagnostic methods, drugs and vaccines.
Regarding these goals, it is clear that health services research goes hand in hand with health economics, which evaluates the benefits of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in relation to the costs.
Both scientific fields have focus principally on gynaecology and particularly on gynaecological oncology in Germany, as can be seen by numerous publications.
These present several advantages compared with clinical trials - they uncover gaps in health care, question the material, staffing and consequently the financial resources required and they allow the estimation of value and the comparison of different innovations to identify the best options for our patients.
Patients with a thoracic trauma are commonly treated by large bore chest tube thoracostomy and appropriate analgesia.
After primary stabilisation of the patients, imaging studies should be performed to assess the extent of the injuries and determine the treatment of choice.
For this reason, patients with thoracic traumas should always be treated in specialised centers.
This approach reduces overall mortality and shortens the length of hospital stay.
The German graduate medical education system is going through an important phase of changes.
Besides the ongoing reform of the national guidelines for graduate medical education (Musterweiterbildungsordnung), other factors like societal and demographic changes, health and research policy reforms also play a central role for the future and competitiveness of graduate medical education. With this position paper, the committee on graduate medical education of the Society for Medical Education (GMA) would like to point out some central questions for this process and support the current discourse. As an interprofessional and interdisciplinary scientific society, the GMA has the resources to contribute in a meaningful way to an evidence-based and future-oriented graduate medical education strategy. In this position paper, we use four key questions with regards to educational goals, quality assurance, teaching competence and policy requirements to address the core issues for the future of graduate medical education in Germany.
Endocrine disorders are common in internal medicine.
Diagnosis of endocrine diseases are usually based on patient history, clinical assessment and laboratory investigations.
This article will focus on frequently used laboratory investigations for endocrine diseases such as diabetes, thyroid dysfunction, male hypogonadism and adrenal insufficiency.
In particular, pre-analytical and analytical variability of biochemical measures as well as its significance in clinical practice will be discussed.
The literature was systematically searched and evaluated using the criteria of the Oxford Center of Evidence Based Medicine.
The body of evidence used to formulate these recommendations was reviewed and approved by representatives of 17 national societies.
Three grades of recommendation were used as follows: Grade "A" (strong recommendation), Grade "B" (recommendation) and Grade "0" (open recommendation).
The result is a comprehensive, interdisciplinary, evidence and consensus-based set of level 3 guidelines.
This publication was designed for all ICU professionals, and takes into account all critically ill patient populations.
Patients with peripheral arterial disease have a high rate of cardiac, cerebrovascular, or pulmonary comorbidities.
Peripheral arterial surgical interventions are associated with a moderate to high perioperative cardiac risk.
Simple clinical scoring systems for preoperative risk stratification can be used to identify high-risk patients.
In these patients further diagnostic and therapeutic measures are required to reduce perioperative morbidity and mortality.
In contrast, a group of patients can be identifed that do not require additional cardiopulmonary diagnostics and can immediately proceed to the intervention.
According to evidence-based recommendations in patients at risk beta blocker should be uptitrated and statin therapy should be initiated preoperatively.
Quitting smoking preoperatively also reduces perioperative complications and should be encouraged in all patients.
This article point out guidelines for the general practitioner when he can manage himself ophthalmic emergencies, which patients an ophthamologist should see on the same day and when an immediate intervention by an ophthalmologist is necessary.
Caudal cruciate ligament injury can be a complication following tibial plateau leveling osteotomy (TPLO) (Slocum und Slocum, 1993) especially if the post-operative Tibial Plateau Angle (TPA) is less than 5 degree.
We describe a case of negative TPA associated with partial cranial and caudal ligament rupture treated with a center of rotation of angulation (CORA) based cranial tibial opening wedge osteotomy and tibial tuberosity transposition.
A 13 kg, mixed breed dog was presented for right pelvic limb lameness.
Radiographically a bilateral patella baja and a malformed tibia tuberosity along with a bilateral TPA of -8 degree were detected.
Arthroscopically a partial rupture of the cranial and caudal cruciate ligaments were found.
The osteotomy was fixed with a 8 holes ALPS 9 (KYON, Switzerland) and a 3-holes 2.0mm UniLock plate (Synthes, Switzerland).
Then a proximal tibial tuberosity transposition of 10mm was performed and fixed with a pin and tension band construct.
The postoperative TPA was 15 degree.
The radiographic controls at 6, 10 weeks, 6 months and 1 year after surgery revealed an unchanged position of the implants and progressive healing of the osteotomies.
At the 6 and 12 months recheck evaluation the dog had no evidence of lameness or stifle pain and radiographs revealed complete healing of the osteotomy site and no implant failure.
The diaphyseal CORA based osteotomy allowed accurate correction of a proximal tibial deformity associated with negative TPA.
Cement-augmented pedicle screws can increase the stability of fixators for unstable vertebral fractures in the elderly.
Fixators can be inserted quickly and with minimally invasive techniques, reducing surgical risks.
From March 2012 until July 2014, we treated 40 patients with percutaneous augmented fixators for unstable vertebral fractures.
Average age was 77.5 years.
During the six month observation period, no patients died.
There were no neurological deficits.
On VAS, average pain decreased from 8.5 to 4.1 points postoperatively.
The average Cobb angle of 4.1° was improved after surgery.
After 6 months, bony consolidation yielded angles of 1 to 4°, average 2.6°.
There was often venous extravasation of cement leaking from the augmented vertebrae, even extending to pulmonary embolism.
The emboli were usually asymptomatic.
We report a case where the patient required resuscitation immediately after cement application because of pulmonary emboli.
The patient survived because of the immediately implemented critical care measures.
Little has been published about this risk, which is underestimated despite increasing numbers of augmented fixator operations.
The risk can be reduced with slower cement injection, smaller cement applicators, and short term positive pressure ventilation with PEEP.
Many premenopausal patients who develop breast cancer have not yet completed their family planning, so measures of fertility protection to preserve their fertile potential would be beneficial.
Polychemotherapy causes irreversible damage to the ovarian follicles - irrespective of whether in a neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting - and this can sometimes result in permanent infertility.
Depending on which cytostatic agents are used and on the age-related ovarian reserve of the woman, gonadotoxic risk must be classified as low, moderate or high.
Options of fertility preservation include: a) cryopreservation of fertilised or unfertilised oocytes.
After ovarian hyperstimulation, mature oocytes are retrieved by transvaginal follicle aspiration, after which they are cryopreserved, either unfertilised or on completion of IVF or ICSI treatment.
During b) cryopreservation of ovarian tissue, about 50% of the ovarian cortex of one ovary is resected with the aid of a laparoscopic procedure and cryopreserved.
The application of c) GnRH agonists as a medicinal therapy option is an attempt at endocrine ovarian suppression in order to protect oocytes, granulosa cells and theca cells from the cytotoxic effect of chemotherapy.
Parenteral nutrition is a fundamental part of any therapeutic concept in critically ill patients.
Despite a controversial discussion newer strategies recommend the parenteral nutrition as a very important supplemental component to an early enteral nutrition therapy.
The diagnosis "HIV infection" has severe consequences.
False positive or false negative HIV results must be avoided.
The Swiss Federal Office of Public Health generated a concept for HIV testing which also includes the characterization of HIV for optimal medical care of the HIV-infected patient.
This concept requests that the following four questions are answered: 1.
Is the patient indeed HIV-infected?
Is it HIV-1 or HIV-2, and if the patient is tested positive for HIV-1, what group, M or O?
An important initial step in the medication process is prescription writing.
The more perfect it is, the more successfully can a therapy be performed.
Imprecisions and missing information lead to unnecessary queries or to errors which are often randomly discovered during a later consultation.
A "perfect prescription" serves every individual involved in the medication process. The prescription document contains the instructions for the patient, the pharmacist, the nurse, and other health professionals involved in the therapy.
The prescription writing process is regulated by several laws and decrees which were enacted to assure the greatest possible drug safety.
Deviations from the norm may be necessary in individual cases, which require an even more responsible prescribing and explicit indication.
Similarly, there is considerable uncertainty among anaesthesiologists, internists and surgeons with respect to the perioperative management of the patient's long-term medication.
Therefore, the German Scientific Societies of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine (DGAI), Internal Medicine (DGIM) and Surgery (DGCH) have joined to elaborate recommendations on the preoperative evaluation of adult patients prior to elective, non-cardio-thoracic surgery, which have been initially published in 2010.
In the first part the general principles of preoperative evaluation are described (part A).
The current concepts for extended evaluation of patients with known or suspected major cardiovascular disease are presented in part B. Finally, the perioperative management of patients' long-term medication is discussed (part C).
These recommendations will be subject to regular re-evaluation and updating when new validated evidence becomes available.
Patients with the first diagnosis of a Castleman's disease at the ENT clinic of Ulm University during the years 2011-2015 were included.
The duration of the rather weak symptoms was inhomogenous and lasted from 14 days to 14 years.
After diagnostic exstirpation a hyaline-vascular type of Castelman's disease was confirmed in all cases.
One of the 5 cases proved a multicentric type with an additional axillary manifestation, the others were monocentric.
In all patients the diagnostic exstirpation was sufficient for therapy without need for adjuvant medication.
The ENT specialist encounters Castleman's disease mostly as a long-lasting swelling of cervical lymph nodes refractory to therapy and without severe concomittant symptoms.
Due to potentially unfavorable outcomes a timely diagnostic lymph node exstirpation under general anesthesia is indicated. In most cases this surgical intervention represents the sufficient therapy.
Hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy may represent a diagnostic challenge in clinical practice.
This article is intended to facilitate differential diagnosis by a systematic description of relevant pathologies, notably with occupational etiology.
Clinical findings of relevant diseases, i. e. of tuberculosis, chronic beryllium disease, sarcoidosis, lung cancer, malignant lymphoma, Epstein-Barr virus infection, and histoplasmosis are compared.Case history, imaging and laboratory tests have important diagnostic impact. But also invasive methods can be necessary in order to exclude and prove malignancy, infection or autoimmune disease.
With the increase of endoprosthetic knee replacements, there is also an increase of critical wounds to the knee due to a high incidence of soft tissue problems (ranging from wound healing defects to severe wound infections).
In October 2014 the European Federation of Societies for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology formed a Gastrointestinal Ultrasound (GIUS) task force group to promote the use of GIUS in a clinical setting.
One of the main objectives of the task force group was to develop clinical recommendations and guidelines for the use of GIUS under the auspices of EFSUMB.
The first part, gives an overview of the examination techniques for GIUS recommended by experts in the field.
It also presents the current evidence for the interpretation of normal sonoanatomical and physiological features as examined with different ultrasound modalities.
