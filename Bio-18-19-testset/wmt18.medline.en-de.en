This case report describes 3 kittens with suspected doramectin toxicity.
In a litter of 7 kittens treated with doramectin, 3 developed neurological symptoms. One kitten showed mild apathy and tremors, while a second one additionally presented behavioral changes and seizures that had to be treated with diazepam.
Both kittens recovered completely.
A third kitten was presented to us in coma 3 days following treatment with doramectin. Subsequently, this kitten developed behavioral changes such as aggression, hyperesthesia, tremors, and seizures and died 36 hours after presentation.
Histopathologic examination of the brain showed cytotoxic edema and polioencephalomalacia.
The doramectin dosage of the deceased kitten was 380 μg/kg.
We report the case of a previously healthy young man who presented to the hospital with hemoptysis and dyspnea.
Hemoptysis is a frequently encountered symptom in daily routine and investigations can easily be deferred to a longer time frame.
Our case illustrates the importance of a prompt investigation and treatment of underlying causes. Furthermore one should not hesitate to include rare, yet life threatening conditions in differential diagnosis.
Large epidemiological databases are often used to examine matters pertaining to drug utilization, health services, and drug safety.
In general, the results of the LRx studies were found to be clearly in line with previously published reports.
Numerous research centres apply magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for research purposes in children.
In view of this practical research, ethical concerns regarding the strains the study participants are exposed to during the MRI examination are discussed.
The study evaluates whether an MRI examination induces negative emotions in children and adolescents which are more intense than the ones caused by electroencephalography (EEG), an examination method currently classified as causing "minimal stress."
Furthermore, the emotional stress induced by the MRI examination in children and adolescents is compared with that induced in adults.
At present, the study is in the stage of data collection.
This article presents the study design of the MRI research project.
Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia occurring in 2 % of the population.
Aside from initiating oral anticoagulation in patients with an increased risk for thromboembolic complications, rhythm control often is the therapeutic target, particularly in the young and highly symptomatic.
The ablation of patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation has emerged as an alternative to long-term treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs.
In the case of long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation, there is no agreement about the ablation strategy and the success rates are significantly lower.
This review addresses the underlying pathophysiology, the ablation techniques, success rates and complications as well as alternative invasive treatment options.
Posterior shoulder instability is a rare clinical condition that encompasses different degrees of severity including various possible pathologies involving the labrum, capsule, bony lesions, and even locked posterior dislocation.
When focusing on soft tissue involvement, the diagnosis of posterior instability may be difficult to make because frequently patients report vague symptoms not associated with a clear history of traumatic shoulder dislocation.
Pathological soft tissue conditions associated with posterior instability in most cases are related to posterior labral tear and/or posterior capsular detensioning/tear.
The diagnosis can be facilitated by physical examination using specific clinical tests (i. e., jerk test, Kim test, and reinterpreted O'Brien test) together with appropriate imaging studies (i. e., magnetic resonance arthrography).
Arthroscopy may help in a complete evaluation of the joint and allows for the treatment of soft tissue lesions in posterior instability.
Caution is warranted in the case of concomitant posterior glenoid chondral defect as a potential cause of poor outcome after soft tissue repair in posterior instability.
Although the setting up of centres and the subsequent need for certification are associated with a marked increase in costs, initial data show positive effects on quality.
Certified centres are cost-effective from the point of view of health economics - they lead to improved quality in processes and results without creating any increase in costs for the funding bodies.
Increasing consolidation of inpatient services is also involved, while shortening of the patients' hospitalization periods is leading to reduced remuneration from the funding bodies.
It will only be possible to maintain the high quality achieved if additional charges become available to cover the centres' added costs.
Good data are increasingly becoming available as a basis for negotiations on charges - e.g., with regard to the quality of results and the National Cancer Plan - as well as clear support from patients.
The statement of the Federal Association of Physicians of Public Health Services provides recommendations concerning tuberculosis screening of refugees and asylum seekers on arrival specific to different groups of persons (adults, children, pregnant women, unaccompanied minors), taking into account the legal background and the current recommendations of the Robert Koch Institute as well as of the German Society for Pediatric Infectiology.
In addition, recommendations are given to ensure treatment success in refugees and asylum seekers with tuberculosis, to carry out contact investigations and for preventive treatment of latent tuberculosis infection among refugees and asylum seekers.
Back pain ist frequently found in patients with somatoform disorders, particularly in somatisation and somatoform pain disorders.
About 10 % to 20 % of patients suffering from back pain can be diagnosed with somatoform pain disorders. Additionally, up to 50 % of back pain patients suffer from other psychiatric disorders like major depression or anxiety disorders.
Treatment usually consists of psychological/behavioral interventions in combination with relaxation techniques, physical activation and antidepressants.
Infection is a serious complication after implantation of total knee-prostheses.
Recognised methods of treatment include immobilisation and systemic antibiotics.
With a steadily increasing number of treatments, the mean age of the patients increased to 67.3 years.
In 34.3% of these patients, spondylodiscitis developed spontaneously and 68.6% of patients did not receive treatment until the diagnosis.
In the context of the specific treatment, pain intensity decreased from 6.0 to 3.1 NRS (numeric rating scale).
The inflammatory values (CRP) decreased from 119.2 to 46.7 mg/dl.
The time from the onset of symptoms to the surgical treatment was almost 65.6 days and has not changed significantly.
Nevertheless, the time from admission to surgical treatment could be reduced to less than 3 days.
Treatment with monoclonal antibodies (mabs) has become an established component of oncological therapy.
The monoclonal antibodies available for this purpose are mainly administered intravenously in individually adapted doses according to body weight over longer treatment times.
For other chronic diseases such as, for example, diabetes mellitus, the subcutaneous administration of drugs is an established therapy option.
For the subcutaneous administration of larger volumes as needed for mab solutions the extracellular matrix of the subcutaneous tissue represents a problem.
The co-formulation with recombinant human hyaluronidase makes the relatively pain-free administration of larger fluid volumes and thus the subcutaneous administration of monoclonal antibodies possible, as illustrated by the development of a subcutaneous formulation of trastuzumab.
This constitutes a less invasive, time-optimised and flexible form of administration for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer that, with its fixed dosing possibilities, contributes to therapeutic safety.
The example of trastuzumab shows that the subcutaneous administration of monoclonal antibodies can simplify oncological long-term therapy not only for the patients but also for the medical personnel.
Uterine artery embolisation (UAE) is an established procedure to treat uterine fibroids as an alternative to surgery.
The combination of both approaches is reserved for only a few cases.
A preoperative UAE (PUAE) contributes to reducing bleeding complications and helps preserve the uterus.
The number of new HIV-1 infections remains stable in Switzerland over the last years thanks to the effective prevention programs.
However, the aim to halve the new HIV infection rate has not been reached.
Early identification of patients at risk of acquiring HIV infection and counselling "safer sex" rules as well as treating HIV-infected patients plays a decisive role in this program.
Transmission occurs more often orally or rectally than vaginally and patients are often asymptomatic.
Condoms provide only limited protection.
Testing and treatment of infected patients is primordial as well as contact tracing.
This commentary seeks to enable comparisons about clinical skills teaching in Germany and the UK.
Through the example of the University of Southampton we show how clinical skills teaching is integrated both vertically and horizontally.
With improved prognosis due to advances in the diagnosis and therapy of breast cancer, physicians and therapists now focus on aspects such as quality of life and the management of side effects from breast cancer treatment.
Therapy- and disease-related side effects often reduce the patient's quality of life and can place a further burden on patients, with non-compliance or discontinuation of therapy a potential consequence.
Study data have shown that therapy- and disease-related side effects can be reduced using the methods of integrative medicine.
Reported benefits include improving patients' wellbeing and quality of life, reducing stress, and improving patients' mood, sleeping patterns and capacity to cope with disease.
Examining the impact of integrative medicine on the side effects of cancer treatment would be beyond the scope of this review. This article therefore looks at short-term side effects of cancer treatment which are usually temporary and occur during or after local and systemic therapy.
The focus is on mind-body medicine, acupuncture and classic naturopathic treatments developed by Sebastian Kneipp as complementary therapies.
The latter includes hydrotherapy, phytotherapy, nutritional therapy, exercise therapy and a balanced lifestyle.
The probability of healing breast cancer has been greatly improved in recent decades through the introduction and optimisation of multi-modal therapies and interdisciplinary treatments.
To prevent excessive treatment, patients whose prognosis is so good that certain adjuvant therapies can be foregone or reduced must be identified.
A lack of compliance with therapy, especially in the endocrine therapies stretching over years, is a further problem.
As only treatments that are also carried out can improve chances of survival, efforts to improve compliance must be intensified.
Studies show that lifestyle changes influence the efficiency of medication on the one hand, and on the other hand can also by themselves achieve a relevant improvement of the prognosis.
Therefore, it is time not only to treat the tumour, but to also focus on the patient as a whole in therapeutic interventions.
Oncologic therapy is currently undergoing significant changes.
A number of innovative targeted medications currently in clinical development have raised high expectations.
With that in mind, discussions about terms such as "clinical benefit" and "clinical relevance" are highly topical.
This also applies to further developments in the field of adjuvant systemic therapies for early-stage breast cancer.
As the treatment aim is curative, assessment of the clinical benefit of adjuvant therapies must be largely based on efficacy outcomes.
The focus must be on improving disease-free survival rates and lowering the risk of recurrence.
Because of the current low mortality rates, statements about overall survival rates are only possible after very long observation periods.
Consequently, new drugs in adjuvant therapies should be considered as offering a clinical benefit, if they reduce the risk of recurrence below current low levels of risk.
The evidence for established adjuvant therapy standards in early-stage breast cancer can be used as objective criteria for comparison.
This review article considers the requirements for clinical benefit of new adjuvant therapies for early breast cancer, based on examples from adjuvant endocrine therapy, adjuvant polychemotherapy and adjuvant anti-HER2 therapy.
The lately inured § 137 h SGB V aims to assess the benefit of new examination and treatment methods with medical devices of class IIb and III.
In the future, the decision on the reimbursement eligibility will be marked by high requirements in terms of documentation of benefits and harm.
The objective of benefit assessment is the operationalization of benefit to patients.
A comparative determination of benefit enables rational decision by regulatory authorities.
The process of benefit assessment should guarantee transparent decision-making, and the underlying medical and health economic fundamentals should be documented.
In principle, benefit assessment can be divided into 3 phases: measuring causal effects of an intervention, assessment of the measured effects and decision on reimbursement based on the aggregation of an overall benefit.
The first home pregnancy test was introduced in 1976. Since then, pregnancy tests have become the most common diagnostic assay used at home.
Exclusion of individuals with mental disorders is common, especially exclusion from the work force.
It can be shown that work and inclusion in the workforce is an important topic and that occupational status is discussed early in the treatment process.
Low back pain (LBP) continues to be a major health problem causing personal suffering and enormous socioeconomic costs.
Evidence suggests that more than 85 % of individuals with LBP suffer from non-specific low back pain.
Physiotherapy for non-specific LBP includes educational, physical, manual and movement therapy measures.
In the acute phase, it is very important to prevent chronicity by identifying barriers for a full recovery and a quick return to everyday activities.
If there is a chronicity of symptoms, the treatment must focus on improvement of the general physical activity despite the pain and promote participation in the social and work context.
These aims are more important than pain relief.
Therefore in the acute phase educational and activity-promoting measures are the primary treatment options.
In the sub-acute and chronic phase a multidimensional treatment approach including exercise therapy with the aim of improving function, including return to work, should be applied.
By now, there is scientific evidence that physiotherapy can reduce pain and disability due to LBP, and that return to usual activities including work can be achieved.
While NIPT is being implemented rapidly, the implementation of a corresponding specialized counselling process in many respects lags behind. As a consequence, legal requirements and other testing conditions sometimes are not fulfilled adequately.
The midsagittal view of the fetal profile is essential in first trimester screening at 11 + 0 to 13 + 6 weeks of gestation.
The aim of this review is to summarize the additional information that can be gained from the fetal profile view.
The appropriate surgical technique to treat patients with uterine fibroids is still a matter of debate as is the potential risk of incorrect treatment if histological examination detects a uterine sarcoma instead of uterine fibroids.
The published epidemiology for uterine sarcoma is set against the incidence of accidental findings during surgery for uterine fibroids.
International comments on this topic are discussed and are incorporated into the assessment by the German Society for Gynecology and Obstetrics (DGGG).
Categorical qualifiers were defined to analyze the data provided by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the German Federal Bureau of Statistics (DESTATIS; Hospital and Causes of Death Statistics), the population-based Cancer Register of Bavaria.
A systematic search was done of the MEDLINE database and the Cochrane collaboration, covering the period from 1966 until November 2014.
The incidence of uterine sarcoma and uterine fibroids in uterine surgery was compared to the literature and with the different registries.
The incidence of uterine sarcoma in 2010, standardized for age, was 1.53 for Bavaria, or 1.30 for every 100 000 women, respectively, averaged for the years 2002-2011, and 1.30 for every 100 000 women in Germany.
The mean incidence collated from various surveys was 2.02 for every 100 000 women (0.35-7.02; standard deviation 2.01).
The numbers of inpatient surgical procedures such as myoma enucleation, morcellation, hysterectomy or cervical stump removal to treat the indication "uterine myoma" have steadily declined in Germany across all age groups (an absolute decrease of 17 % in 2012 compared to 2007).
There has been a shift in the preferred method of surgical access from an abdominal/vaginal approach to endoscopic or endoscopically assisted procedures to treat uterine fibroids, with the use of morcellation increasing by almost 11 000 coded procedures in 2012.
Based on international statements (AAGL, ACOG, ESGE, FDA, SGO) on the risk of uterine sarcoma as an coincidental finding during uterine fibroid surgery and the associated risk of a deterioration of prognosis (in the case of morcellation procedures), this overview presents the opinion of the DGGG in the form of four Statements, five Recommendation and four Demands.
As the authors are operational managers as well as QA (Quality Assurance) experts, both aspects are represented to come up with efficient and qualitative ways of future monitoring according to ICH GCP.
The present case report describes a 6-year old subfertile pony mare, which became pregnant after the eleventh artificial insemination.
The examination of the ovaries and the uterus did not reveal any abnormal clinical findings and the mare showed a regular oestrous cycle.
Based on cytogenetic and molecular genetic analyses it became possible to elucidate the observed subfertility.
A PCR analysis failed to amplify sequences from the equine SRY gene.
The observed classic 63,X/64,XX mosaicism is a plausible explanation for the subfertility of the mare.
The attendance of an in-patient therapy program is often an indispensable part in the treatment of addiction disorders.
The different stages of treatment, its elements of therapy as well as advantages and disadvantages of a stationary setting are discussed.
The importance of an individualized therapy matched with the stage of detoxification and withdrawal is shown on the example of the Klinik Südhang, where patients with alcohol and/or drug addiction disorders seek treatment.
To determine bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 protein and Aggrecan in osteoarthritic and healthy cartilage with special regard to localization and degree of cartilage damage 95 samples representing osteoarthritic cartilage and 17 samples out of normal cartilage were graded histological by Mankin Score and were studied by immunohistochemistry for the expression of BMP-2 and Aggrecan.
BMP-2 protein was detected intracellular in normal and in osteoarthritic cartilage.
Extracellular BMP-2 was detected exclusively in osteoarthritic cartilage and exhibits characteristic extracellular patterns: samples with BMP-2 in the extracellular matrix show BMP-2 negative coronae around BMP-2 positive cells.
There is a statistically significant increase in the prevalence of extracellular BMP-2 with increasing ICRS grade/Mankin grade.
Borderline ovarian tumours are semimalignant tumours occurring unilaterally or bilaterally with a peak incidence among women of reproductive age.
Since the affected women often wish to preserve fertility, particular precautions must be taken when counselling the patient and obtaining consent prior to planning an individual treatment.
Options for preserving fertility include an organ-sparing surgical procedure and cryopreservation of oocytes and/or ovarian tissue.
In this article, we report on a 25-year-old patient with a bilateral seromucinous borderline tumour who desired all fertility-preserving options.
In order to perform the procedure without delay, we opted to perform luteal phase stimulation prior to oocyte retrieval.
We conclude by discussing the current literature on the state of fertility preservation in the treatment of borderline ovarian tumours.
The treatment of pain after thoracic surgery is a challenge and takes place in the individual clinics mostly according to clinic internal standards.
Many different fungi, including yeasts and molds, can be found in the intestinal tract of humans constituting the gut mycobiome.
In case the bacterial flora is altered, the fungal flora may react inversely.
By a so-called fungal diet, however, the composition of the mycobiome can hardly be influenced.
Whereas some fungi are only transiently present in the gut after oral uptake, others, such as Candida, Saccharomyces, Rhodotorula, Trichosporon, Geotrichum, amongst others, are members of the residential, autochthonous gut flora.
Some of these fungi exert beneficial effects, for example by synthesizing useful materials.
Rhodotorula can produce fatty acids and carotenoids.
Others are able to metabolize toxic compounds, for example mycotoxins as well as procarcinogenic items in food.
Toxins, as well as pathogenic bacteria, can be bound to mannans on the surface of fungi und can consequently be exported.
Some fungi are said to exert probiotic activities.
Certain fungal constituents, such as glucans, may even stimulate the immune system.
On the other hand, some fungi cannot only colonize the gut asymptomatically but can also be noxious under certain conditions when, for example, the bacterial flora is disturbed. By means of their virulence factors, they can damage the gut epithelium and even penetrate into the Mukosa inducing inflammation, They can also aggravate chronic inflammatory processes.
Fungi play a role in the development of obesity.
Lastly, fungi in the gut represent a reservoir from which they may spread to other sites when the conditions are favorable.
The results of the studies indicate a protective effect of pit and fissure sealants, particularly for children and adolescents at high caries risk.
Additionally, the economic evaluation suggests a tendency for cost savings in this group.
Nevertheless, a general expansion of the intervention cannot be recommended.
A swelling palpated adjacent to the spinous processes of the 9th to 12th thoracic vertebrae was identified via ultrasonography as an abscess located on the transverse processes of these vertebrae.
Magnetic resonance imaging of the lamb postmortem revealed that the abscess had invaded the vertebral canal through a channel at the level of the 9th thoracic vertebra causing extradural spinal cord compression.
Pointe shoes - developed more than hundred years ago and almost unaltered since then - are highly specific and strike a balance between aesthetics, function, protection, and health care.
Therefore, pointe readiness should be tested prior to all dance training or career training.
Medical specialists are often confronted with this issue.
Specific anatomical dance technique-orientated general conditional and coordinative preconditions as well as dance-technical prerequisites must be met by pointe readiness tests in order to keep traumatic injuries or long-term damage at a minimum.
In addition to a (training) history, medical counselling sessions have come to include various tests that enable a reliable decision for or against pointe work.
Pre-marketing and post-marketing clinical studies revealed an improvement of visual function in ocriplasmin treated eyes and showed a release of traction in up to 78% of cases.
We report about an acute monkshood intoxication requiring acute resuscitation in suicidal intent in a 56-year-old patient.
All plant parts contain the highly toxic alkonoid aconitin.
The lethal dose in adults is 2 - 6 mg.
Intoxications are often fatal.
Asymptomatic patients with suspected monkshood intoxication should also be monitored on an ICU.
First signs of intoxication are paraesthesia in the mouth and throat area, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting and severe pain in skeletal muscle.
Affected patients die within hours after ingestion due to respiratory distress and/or cardiac arrhythmia.The most important measure after oral ingestion is to achieve a rapid primary poison elimination clearance (in the case of awareness clear patients, trigger vomiting, otherwise gastric lavage under protective intubation) and the subsequent carbonation.
A specific antidote is not available.
The management of an intoxication consists primarily of the therapy of the rhythm disturbances in the form of magnesium and amiodarone.Strict adherence to protective measures (gloves, masks) must be strictly observed.
A direct skin contact with plant parts is to be avoided as well as the potential contact with vomit or aspirate.
Urinary incontinence in women is a common problem.
With increasing age its prevalence and severity of its manifestations increase.
Among nursing home residents the frequency is between 43 and 77 %, 6 to 10 % of all admissions to nursing homes are due to urinary incontinence.
The risk for urinary incontinence among women with cognitive deficits is 1.5- to 3.4-fold higher than for women without mental disorders.
The most common form is stress incontinence (50 %), followed by mixed stress-urge incontinence (40 %) and purely urge incontinence (OAB = overactive bladder, 20 %).
With regard to its cause, the latter remains unclarified in about 80 % of the cases.
It is often difficult to treat.
There are also cases in which urge incontinence is related to traumatic events.
In such cases behavioural and psychotherapeutic options may be helpful.
Almost inevitably every form of incontinence has psychological consequences: shame and insecurity are often results of uncontrolled loss of urine.
Among others, in the long term, they lead to the avoidance of social contacts and possibly to depression and isolation.
Consideration of the psychosomatics is important in the therapy for female urinary incontinence from three points of view: 1) the efficacy of treatment is better suited to the patient, 2) the treatment costs are lower, 3) the professional satisfaction of the responsible physician increases.
The general practitioner or pediatrician mostly is the first point of contact for overweight children and may recognize adiposity early enough in order to start therapy of obesity or comorbidity or to initiate measures of prevention.
As obesity requires care of the entire family, close or recurring contact with the overweight child and its family is important as well as the treatment nearby their residence.
Therefore, various techniques of treatment of alcohol or tobacco addiction can be used and recommendations for improvement of self-worth as well as healthy eating behavior and exercise are presented.
First feasible objectives include modest lifestyle changes and reduction of comorbidities; if an extreme obesity with a BMI above 99.5th percentile or mental disorders are present or if it becomes apparent within the first 6 months that the patient cannot achieve his own goals for changes in lifestyle and body weight, a referral to a specialized center is indicated. There, a multi-professional treatment of the child and his family is performed in common by specialists for nutrition, exercise and psychology.
Childhood obesity is a chronic disease that requires a very long-term treatment and usually persists into adulthood.
Therapeutic goals are a permanently stable, painless cervical spine and the protection against secondary neurologic damage while retaining the greatest possible amount of motion and spinal profile.
Due to its ease of use and its proven good reliability, the AOSpine classification for subaxial cervical injuries should be used.
The Canadian C-Spine Rule is recommended as a clinical decision rule whether to perform imaging or not.
If a structural or unstable injury is suspected by patient history or clinical findings, a spiral CT scan of the cervical spine is the favoured diagnostic modality.
Conventional X-ray is reserved for patients in whom there is no "dangerous mechanism of injury".
MR imaging is recommended in case of unexplained neurologic deficit, prior to closed reduction and open posterior surgery and to exclude disco-ligamentous injuries. Urgency of MR imaging depends on the specific findings.
CT angiography is recommended in higher-grade facet joint injuries or in the presence of vertebra-basilar symptoms.
Flexion-extension imaging is recommended only as a physician-guided dynamic fluoroscopy, when an unstable lesion is still suspected.
The therapeutic strategy is mainly dependent on morphologic criteria, which are described using the AOSpine classification.
A0-injuries are treated conservatively.
A1- and A2-injuries are treated conservatively in the majority of cases, and in single cases a gross kyphotic deformity might indicate surgical stabilisation.
A3-injuries do indicate a surgical therapy in the majority of cases, but certain cases might be treated conservatively.
A4-fractures as well as B- and C-type injuries are to be treated surgically.
Most injuries can be treated by anterior plate stabilisation with interbody support; when a complete burst fracture is present, corpectomy and vertebral body replacement is necessary. In certain cases, an additive posterior or pure posterior instrumentation might be possible or even mandatory.
Injuries in an ankylosing spine (M3-modifier) should be treated preferably from posterior with long-segment instrumentation.
The benefits of minimally invasive surgery for oncology patients and the quality of this treatment are well documented. Outcomes and quality of minimally invasive surgical procedures to treat cervical cancer were evaluated based on retrospective and case-control studies; outcomes and quality after minimally invasive treatment für early-stage low-risk endometrial cancer were also assessed in prospective randomized studies.
If indicated, laparoscopic lymphadenectomy is both technically feasible and oncologically safe. Adipose patients in particular benefit from minimally invasive procedures, where feasible.
The potential role of laparoscopy in neoadjuvant therapy for ovarian cancer and in surgery for early-stage ovarian carcinoma is still controversially discussed and is currently being assessed in further studies.
Using a minimally invasive approach in gynecologic oncology procedures demands strict adherence to oncological principles and requires considerable surgical skill.
In 1828, the Society of Swiss Veterinarians (GST) raised a prize question in regard to the symptoms, etiology and prophylaxis of polyarthritis in the foal.
The treatise of Matthias Anker on this subject was treated with distinction and published in 1830.
His statements answered both the questions to the clinical aspects and referred also to epidemiological, pathological, economical and ethical issues as well as husbandry and relations with the breeders.
The comprehensive article of Anker in a lucid language and obliging views still finds great interest today, as the septicemia is one of the big problems in stud medicine now as before.
Moreover it is astonishing that the recommendations of Anker were disregarded too often.
The reasons for this fact may be due to the inadequate transfer of knowledge, on the one hand because of the educational system in that time, on the other side due to the modest economical importance of horse breeding and the neglected formation in this field.
The recommendations are still valid.
Trastuzumab administered in combination with various chemotherapy regimens has led to outstanding improvements in both disease-free survival and overall survival.
So far, thousands of patients have been treated in this way which has proven to be reasonably safe, with cardiac events being the predominant recognisable toxicity requiring surveillance.
Notwithstanding the large cumulative experience of the oncology community in treating early HER2/neu-positive breast cancer with trastuzumab, some uncertainties remain, with key issues being the ideal time of chemotherapy administration and the optimal duration of trastuzumab therapy.
This paper discusses these issues in the light of the recent updates of some of the pivotal clinical trials in the adjuvant context.
