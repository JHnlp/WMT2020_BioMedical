Lung cancer is one of the most common diseases that endanger health and life of people domestically. A number of recurrence and death of lung cancer originated from metastasis.
As a key step in metastasis of lung cancer, epithelial to mesenchymal transition involved down-regulation of E-cadherin, as well as regulated by EMT transcription factors.
HATs and HDACs is a protein family that catalyzes acetylation and deacetylation of histones. Not only they have vital functions in tumor pathogenesis, but also participate in the EMT of lung cancer.
HATs and HDACs interact with certain EMT transcription factors.
Moreover, the function of these EMT transcription factors may be regulated by acetylation, which has influence on EMT program in lung cancer.
Therefore, this review introduces the event of HATs and HDACs function in EMT of lung cancer, and investigate the molecular mechanism of their interaction. Then, the potential of HDAC inhibitor utilization in the inhibition of EMT and lung cancer therapy were discussed, as to pave the way for the related basic research and clinical practice.
Diabetes and diabetes-induced complications is a rising health concern in Northern Cyprus.
Of the adult population in Northern Cyprus, 12.2% has diabetes and 90% of all individuals suffering from cardiovascular disease are people with diabetes.
The aim of this study was to evaluate nutritional habits of people with diabetes in Northern Cyprus in order to make the necessary recommendations to improve their eating habits to prevent diabetes-induced complications.
We used the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) to evaluate dietary quality of people with diabetes in Northern Cyprus based on their 24-hour food intake.
A total of 200 participants with diabetes were selected randomly from the out-patient clinic of Dr. Burhan NalbantoÄŸlu central hospital in Nicosia.
Individuals were asked to complete a questionnaire to determine their 24-hour food intake and frequency of intake of various food substances.
The mean HEI score for the subjects with diabetes was 58.8.
The HEI component scores for saturated fat, vegetables, dairy products and meat consumption were less than 5, whereas average scores for fat, cholesterol, fruits, grains, and sodium consumption were more than 5.
The meat component of the HEI had the lowest mean score (3.3).
There was statistical significance between male and female subjects regarding the HEI scores for meat and nutrient variety intake.
In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that subjects with diabetes in Northern Cyprus should improve their diet by decreasing their intake of saturated fat and by increasing their intake of vegetables, meat and milk.
Sleep deficiency is becoming widespread in both adults and adolescents and is accompanied by certain behaviors that can lead to obesity.
This study aims to investigate differences in sleep duration of overweight/obese and normal weight groups, and the association between sleep deprivation and obesity, dietary intake and physical activity.
A cross-sectional study was conducted among 226 Iranian working adults (109 men and 117 women) aged 20 to 55 years old who live in Tehran.
Body weight, height, waist and hip circumferences were measured, and BMI was calculated.
Questionnaires, including the Sleep Habit Heart Questionnaire (SHHQ), International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and 24-hour dietary recall, were interview-administered.
Subjects were categorized as normal weight (36.3%) or overweight/obese (63.7%) based on WHO standards (2000).
Overweight/ obese subjects slept significantly (p
The Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011 left many evacuees with insufficient food and emergency shelter.
However, there is no evidence concerning the factors affecting dietary circumstances in emergency shelters after disasters.
To clarify the factors that influenced the provision of meals, we reanalyzed a data set from a dietary survey conducted in emergency shelters one month after the Great East Japan Earthquake (2011).
Among the 69 shelters in "city A," 53 (79.1%) had food shortages.
The possibility of cooking in the emergency shelter improved the provision of meals to evacuees.
When comparing emergency shelters with and without cooking equipment, the shelters with cooking equipment provided more meals, as well as more dishes containing grains and vegetables.
When there was a gas supply, the twice per day provision of "balanced" meals (containing grains, vegetables, and meat/fish) was more frequent than when there was no gas supply.
Interestingly, neither the water supply nor the electricity supply affected the provision of balanced meals.
Further, emergency shelters with larger numbers of evacuees had a lower possibility of cooking and lower availability of gas supply.
Our results demonstrate that early improvements to post-disaster meal provision may maintain the health of evacuees.
Such improvements could be achieved by 1) the speedy restoration of the gas supply to enable cooking, and 2) limiting the number of evacuees per emergency shelter.
Populations with special physiological state, such as pregnant, nursing and women of child-bearing age, have been identified as nutritionally vulnerable during natural disaster.
The objective of this survey was to evaluate the prevalence of anaemia and micronutrient status of women of reproductive age in April 2009 one year after the Wenchuan Earthquake.
The survey recruited 58 pregnant, 66 lactating and 242 women of child-bearing age from 19 to 45 years. The concentrations of haemoglobin in whole blood and ferritin and micronutrients in serum were assayed.
Among the three groups (pregnant, nursing and child-bearing women), respectively, the prevalence of anaemia was 29.1%, 25.5% and 28.8%; that of iron deficiency was 45.4%, 49.0% and 52.9%; and that of zinc deficiency was 45.4%, 23.0% and 33.5%. The sum of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency was more than 90% in each group, and the total vitamin B12 deficiency and marginal deficiency prevalence percentages were 47.3%, 17.7% and 35.7%, respectively.
The prevalence of vitamin A deficiency and marginal deficiency was 1.8% and 9.1% in pregnant women, 6.1% and 15.2% in nursing women and 8.6% and 21.3% in women of child-bearing age, respectively.
Our findings indicated that the micronutrient status of women of reproductive age was poor in the disaster areas. Therefore, improving the micronutrient status of these women should be an urgent priority in these areas.
Some reflections from work in the Asia Pacific Region, mostly with WHO, in the past 25 years, and the changes in nutrition seen in this time are shared.
In 1988-89 I helped to start a Centre for Child Nutrition in Chengdu, Sichuan, through the Italian Development Cooperation.
The nutritional problems in urban and rural China, 25 years ago, were similar to those elsewhere in the Region.
Like China, these countries underwent rapid economic development and changes in health patterns, within two decades.
The main problems for child nutrition had to do with infant feeding practices and less breastfeeding: anaemia, protein energy malnutrition and rickets were frequent.
How did China and other countries tackle these and other nutrition problems?
In the 1990s the global nutrition community started working on a problem-solving framework.
In 1992, at the 1st FAO/WHO International Conference on Nutrition, 159 countries agreed to develop national nutrition plans.
In 2014, 22 years later, FAO and WHO invited countries to review their national nutrition situation and plans.
The epidemiological picture today is profoundly different.
Many Asia-Pacific countries have achieved remarkable progress in socio-economic development, including malnutrition reduction.
To reach the MDGs and the post-MDG goals being formulated, the remaining under-nutrition problems need to be alleviated, inequalities between sectors of society reduced, and also the growing threat of overweight/obesity and NCDs prevented and controlled.
Assessing, monitoring and evaluating programmes to improve progress, now requires focusing not only on biological outcomes, but also on food security, programme process, and the policy environment.
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a complex and chronic disease with multiple complications leading to increased mortality and poor quality of life.
Current studies have shown that lowering glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) confers protection against microvascular complications.
However, with more intensive glucose control to achieve HbA1c of less than 6.5%, there seems to be a significant increased risk of mortality and cardiovascular events.
The current recommendation worldwide is for "tailoring" of DM management to risk and also quality of Life (QOL) which is a crucial component in determining the success or failure of DM management.
In Asia, DM has become a health crisis but there is a lack of QOL assessment tool that is specific for Asians with wide spectrum of ethnicity, languages, religions and socio-economic differences.
In this review, we discuss the evolution of DM management over the decade and the issues pertaining to QOL among people living with diabetes in Asia.
Susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) is a magnetic resonance technology with a high resolution, three-dimensional gradient echo and fully velocity compensated sequence. It is also sensitive to substance with different magnetisability. Based on the quantitative reconstruction of SWI, quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) has been used in monitoring the change of intravenous iron, calcium, microbleeds and oxygen content.
This article summarizes principle of QSM and the latest progress of QSM application in the diseases of central nervous system.
To evaluate how prenatal exposure to antioxidant vitamins and heavy metals affects subsequent development.
Maternal serum and cord serum levels of antioxidant vitamins (A, E, and C) were determined.
Full-state, performance, and verbal intelligence quotients (FSIQ, PIQ, and VIQ, respectively) of 97 children were assessed at 5 years of age.
The placental transport ratio (PTR: cord level relative to maternal serum level) of vitamin A (VA) was associated positively with FSIQ score (p=0.041), vitamin E (VE)-PTR was associated positively with PIQ (p=0.002) and FSIQ (p=0.025) scores, and cord serum cadmium (Cd) level was correlated negatively with VIQ score (p=0.025) at 5 years of age.
High VE-PTR protected against low PIQ (OR=0.025; p=0.021) and FSIQ (OR
The concept of lactose intolerance has become embedded in Western medicine and developing economy medicine.
It is based on evidence that intestinal lactase activity persists into later childhood and throughout life in only a minority of the world's population, notably northern European-derived populations.
These people have the T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the rs49882359 allele (C/T), also known as C/T-13910, the MCM6 gene which positively influences the lactase LCT gene.
Other lactase persistent (LP) populations are found in Africa and the Middle East with different genetic variants.
These SNPs represent co-evolution with dairying since the agricultural revolution and nutrient-dependent ecological adaptation.
That said, gastrointestinal symptoms considered due to small intestinal lactose malabsorption are poorly correlated with lactase non-persistence (LNP), the situation for most people.
With LNP, colonic microbiome lactase enables lactose fermentation to occur so that none is found in faeces.
Whether the short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and gases (hydrogen, carbon dioxide and methane) produced cause symptoms is dose-dependent.
Up to 25 g of lactose at any one time can usually be consumed by a LNP person, but its food and meal pattern context, the microbiomic characteristics, age and other factors may alter tolerance.
Thus, the notion that lactose intolerance is a disorder or disease of LNP people is misplaced and has been one of cultural perspective.
What actually matters is whether a particular dairy product as normally consumed give rise to symptoms.
It is, therefore, proposed that lactose tolerance tests be replaced with dairy food tolerance tests.

To investigate the microRNA (miR)-150 expression level in human osteosarcoma cell lines (Saos-2, MG-63) and its function in cell proliferation, and to explore the potential molecular mechanisms.
Methods: MiR-150 expression levels in human osteosarcoma cell lines (Saos-2, MG-63) and normal osteoblast cell line (NHOst) were detected by relative quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR).
MiR-150 was overexpressed in Saos-2 and MG-63 cells by lentivirus infection.
Cell proliferation rates were monitored by MTS assay.
RUNX2 and Î²-actin protein levels were examined by Western blot.
Inhibitory effect of miR-150 on binding RUNX2 3'-UTR was detected by Dual-Luciferase assay.
Results: MiR-150 expression level is lower in human osteosarcoma cell lines (Saos-2, MG-63) compared to the normal osteoblast cell line (NHOst) (0.23Â±0.02 and 0.32Â±0.03 vs 1.00Â±0.02), which showed statistical significance (P
To analyze the clinical characteristics of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) associated peritonitis in the tertiary hospitals and to discuss the preventive and therapeutic strategy.
Methods: The clinical characteristics, pathogens, resistance and outcomes of 126 CAPD associated peritonitis in 104 patients from Jan, 2013 to June, 2016, were retrospectively analyzed.
Results: Among the patients, the incidence rates of abdominal pain, fever, diarrhea and emesis were 104 (82.54%), 56 (44.44%), 49 (38.89%), and 31 (23.60%), respectively.
Among them, 88 patients suffered peritonitis once, other 16 patients suffered multiple peritonitis or recurrent peritonitis for 38 times. Among the 38 times, the numbers for recurrent, repeated or catheter-associated peritonitis were 2, 2, or 3, respectively.
Peritoneal fluids from 103 cases were cultured, and 64 cases were positive in bacteria, with a rate of 62.14%.
A total of 70 strains of bacteria were separated, including 42 strains of gram-positive bacteria, 21 strains of gram-negative bacteria, and 7 strains of fungus.
The most common gram-positive pathogens were Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, while Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the most common gram-negative bacteria. Candida albicans was the major fungal pathogens.
Gram-positive cocci showed resistance to gentamycin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, vancomycin and linezolid, with a rate at 20.00%, 36.11%, 5%, 0%, and 0%, respectively. The gram-negative bacilli were resistent to cefoperazone/sulbactam, gentamycin, cephazolin, and ceftazidime, with a rate at 6.25%, 10.53%, 64.29%, and 15.38%, respectively. There were no imipenem, amikacin, piperacillin/tazobactam-resistant strains were found.
Conclusion: The most common pathogen causing CAPD associated peritonitis is gram-positive bacteria. It is crucial to take the anti-infection therapy for CAPD associated peritonitis early. The positive rates for bacterial culture need to be enhanced through improvement of methods. At the same time, doctors could improve the outcome of CAPD associated peritonitis by adjusting the medication according to the drug sensitivity results.

Conclusion: Shunting surgery can effectively relieve the intracranial pressure caused by meningeal carcinomatosis, decrease the mortality and morbidity caused by intractable intracranial hypertension in these patients, and improve their live quality.
Dental caries is a major disease that threaten human's oral healthy severely with the characteristics of high incidence, low rate of treatment and high rate of retreatment.
At present, restorative treatment remains the main method for caries treatment.
With the development of the Minimally Invasive Cosmetic Dentistry (MICD), reasonable application of various treatment technologies, maximum preservation of tooth tissues and realizing the maximization of treatment effects become problems that call for immediate solution in dental clinics.
In addition, there still exist a large number of old restorations that need standard retreatments.
Here, some difficulty influence factors of dental caries clinical treatment such as systemic and oral factors, individual caries susceptibility, treatment technologies and materials, retreatment methods of old restorations and technique sensitivity are analyzed, and corresponding processing strategies are also put forward.
With the economic growth and better standards of living, the prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is expected to increase dramatically worldwide.
NAFLD is a common chronic inflammation disease.
NF-ÎºB is a transcription factor that plays crucial roles in inflammation, immunity, cell proliferation and apoptosis. It can facilitate the occurrence and development of NAFLD, and the underlying mechanisms are related to insulin resistance, oxidative stress, alteration of intestinal flora, activation of renin angiotensin system, etc.
This commentary was stimulated by discussions held at the First China Antidepressants Research and Development Summit held in Beijing in October 2015.
Hosted by the Chinese Psychiatrist Psychopharmacology Commission and including leading clinicians, neuroscientists, and representatives of the pharmaceutical industry, the summit focused on the major problems that are limiting the development of more effective antidepressant medications.
In the absence of clear biomarkers of depression, clinicians must base treatment decisions on clinical phenomenology; the lack of clear biological targets results in currently available antidepressants that take a long time to be effective, have low rates of full remission, and high rates of relapse.
Basic research on depression by neuroscientists in China is internationally recognized, but the vast proportion of candidate chemical compounds Chinese researchers propose as potential treatments for depression fail when tested clinically.
This high failure rate of proposed agents has rapidly increased the cost of bringing new drugs to market, so pharmaceutical firms prefer to 'tweak' currently approved medications rather than take the financial risk of supporting the development of novel antidepressants.
Thus, the development of new, more effective treatments for depression is at a stalemate.
Given the huge impact of depression on the economic development of China and other countries, it is essential to actively solicit the support of governments and communities in the efforts of clinicians, researchers, and the pharmaceutical industry to overcome this stalemate.
The importance of large cohort studies in China has been increasingly emphasized. As special group in the population, twins provide excellent natural resources since they share the same birthday, maternal intrauterine environment and early family environment. Twin cohorts are unique for and benefit on controlling the confounding factors as age, gender (same-sex twins), genetic background (monozygotic twins) or early environment (being raised together) in the etiological studies on complex diseases.
In this review, we briefly introduce the objectives, current situation, challenges and opportunities related to the Chinese national twin cohort, focusing on the characteristics of twins that are different from other groups in the general population.
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is one of the most common idiopathic interstitial pneumonia. The main symptoms for IPF are dry cough and exertional shortness of breath, which is worsen gradually with the development of pulmonary fibrosis.
Patients with IPF often suffer from sleep disordered breathing (SDB). Sleep architecture for these patients including the sleep efficiency, deep sleep, rapid eye movement sleep and arousal index, are changed, which seriously affects the quality of life.
In the absence of effective therapies, optimizing the quality of life may become a major therapeutic target for IPF. The diagnosis and treatment of SDB can significantly improve the quality of life for patients with IPF.
To observe the sensitivity of transcription mediated amplification (TMA), and to compare its performance with real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) in detecting human immunodeficiency virus RNA (HIV RNA).
Methods: TMA system was established with TaqMan probes, specific primers, moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase, T7 RNA polymerase, and reaction substrates.
The sensitivity of TMA was evaluated by amplifying a group of 10-fold diluted HIV RNA standards which were transcribed in vitro.
A total of 60 plasma of HIV infected patients were measured by TMA and Cobas Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor test to observe the positive rate. The correlation and concordance of the above two technologies were investigated by linear regression and Bland-Altman analysis.
Results: TMA system was established successfully and HIV RNA transcribed standards at concentration of equal or more than 10 copies/mL could be detected by TMA technology.
Among 60 samples of plasma from HIV infected patients, 46 were positively detected and 12 were negatively amplified by both TMA and Cobas reagents; 2 samples were positively tested by Cobas reagent but negatively tested by TMA system. The concordance rate of the two methods was 97.1% and the difference of positive detection rate between the two methods was not statistically significant (P

To study the biological function of DNAH2 (Homo sapiens dynein, axonemal, heavy chain 2) gene, we constructed human stable U2OS cell line of DNAH2 gene knockout through CRISPR/Cas9n double nick system.
The A, B sgRNAs (Single guide RNA) and complementary strands were designed and synthesized. The double-stranded structures were formed during annealing, and connected with Bbsâ…  cohesive ends-containing pX462 linear vector to construct the recombinant eukaryotic expression plasmids, including pX462-DNAH2-A and pX462-DNAH2-B.
After the co-transfection of the two plasmids into U2OS cells, the addition of puromycin and limiting dilution method were used to obtain positive monoclonal cell line. Western blotting assay was then performed to detect the expression of DNAH2 protein, and PCR-sequencing technology was finally utilized to analyze the mutation feature.
The results showed that A, B sgRNAs duplex was successfully inserted into pX462 vector, and DNAH2 protein was not expressed and DNAH2 gene suffered from the frame-shift mutation in U2OS-DNAH2-KO monoclonal cell line. These demonstrated that DNAH2 knockout U2OS stable cell line was successfully constructed through CRISPR/Cas9n double nick system, which providing a useful tool for the study of DNAH2 gene.
Studies on biofilm regulation based on Lux type quorum sensing system in wastewater treatment have attracted much attention. The intervention of quorum sensing system includes both mechanisms of positive and negative control.
The positive invigorating effect improves the efficiency of biofilm wastewater treatment, promotes the production of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) and soluble microbial products (SMP), and increases the yield of biofilm. The negative weakening effect of quorum sensing can decompose the signal molecules needed in the process of biofilm formation, interrupts the gene expression process of biofilm formation, and inhibits the formation of biofilm on MBR membrane surface effectively.
The further study of the structure and mechanism of N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHLs), the immobilization technology and application of quorum quenching bacteria, the synergistic effect verification of different biofouling control methods and the application feasibility of quorum sensing system based technology in more wastewater treatment fields are the next important researches to explore.
Low-intensity extracorporeal shockwave therapy (LI-ESWT) is a novel treatment for erectile dysfunction (ED).
With the property of angiogenesis, LI-ESWT acts on vasculogenic ED by improving penile hemodynamics and endothelial function.
LI-ESWT is proved to be safe and effective in the treatment of vasculogenic ED in various prospective clinical studies, including randomized, double-blind, and sham-controlled trails.
With more multi-centered larger-sample randomized controlled trials, LI-ESWT will play a valuable role in the treatment of ED.
To examine the changes of mimecan protein expression in development of atherosclerosis induced by sinoaortic denervation, and to explore the effects of mimecan knock down on the proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells.
Methods: The animals were randomly divided into a sham group and a model group (n=8 in each group).
The rat model of blood pressure variability was established by sinoaortic denervation, and the hemodynamic indexes were recorded 20 weeks after the surgery to confirm the success of the model.
The thoracic aorta was excised and stained with immunohistochemistry to observe the pathological changes of smooth muscle tissues and the changes of mimecan expression.
Results: Twenty weeks after sinoaortic denervation, the blood pressure variability in the model group was significantly increased compared with that in the sham group, suggesting the model was successfully established.
In addition, the increased blood pressure variability in the model group promoted the proliferation and migration of the vascular smooth muscle cells in thoracic aorta, while the expression of mimecan protein was significantly decreased.
In in vitro assays, the knock down of mimecan in mice vascular smooth muscle cells could promote the cell proliferation and migration.
Conclusion: Mimecan plays a protective role in the development of sinoaortic denervation induced atherosclerosis through amechanism involving suppression of the proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells.
Protein N-termini, as the beginning of translation, has a major impact on protein's biological functions. Its sequence and various post-translational modifications often affect protein activation, stability and cellular-localization, regulate the signal transduction, and even determine protein's final destiny.
The systematic study of protein N-termini can clarify the vital function of the N-terminus, and provide in-depth knowledge of the multifunctional roles that protein has played in diverse biological processes. In addition, N-terminal research may help us to achieve high-coverage proteomics and re-annotate genomics.
Combined with our own research, this review highlights recent progress of N-terminomics, especially some important enrichment strategies and technologies based on mass spectrometry.
Aspergillus niger, as an important industrial fermentation strain, is widely applied in the production of organic acids and industrial enzymes.
With the development of diverse omics technologies, the data of genome, transcriptome, proteome and metabolome of A. niger are increasing continuously, which declared the coming era of big data for the research in fermentation process of A. niger.
The data analysis from single omics and the comparison of multi-omics, to the integrations of multi-omics based on the genome-scale metabolic network model largely extends the intensive and systematic understanding of the efficient production mechanism of A. niger. It also provides possibilities for the reasonable global optimization of strain performance by genetic modification and process regulation.
We reviewed and summarized progress in omics research of A. niger, and proposed the development direction of omics research on this cell factory.
Portal hypertension is one of the main performance of liver cirrhosis, in addition to anatomical factors, hyperdynamic circulatory status caused by abnormal splanchnic vascular tension is also very important in this procession.
We summarised the mechanism and treatment strategies of hyperdynamic circulation in cirrhosis, so as to provide some recommendation for clinical practice.
Hepatic fibrosis is a common pathological process in the development of various chronic liver diseases into liver cirrhosis.
Based on current research findings, it is widely believed that the process of hepatic fibrosis is reversible, and effective treatment cannot only delay the development of hepatic fibrosis into liver cirrhosis, but also alleviate the degree of hepatic fibrosis.
Therefore, the research on the treatment of hepatic fibrosis is of great clinical significance.
The article reviews the recent research advances in the treatment of hepatic fibrosis.
The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is a proteasome system widely present in the human body, which is composed of ubiquitin (Ub), ubiquitin activating enzymes (E1), ubiquitin conjugating enzymes (E2), ubiquitin protein ligases (E3), 26S proteasome, and deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) and involved in cell cycle regulation, immune response, signal transduction, DNA repair as well as protein degradation.
Sperm DNA is vulnerable to interference or damage in the progression of chromosome association and homologous recombination.
Recent studies show that UPS participates in DNA repair in spermatogenesis by modulating DNA repair enzymes via ubiquitination, assisting in the identification of DNA damage sites, raising damage repair-related proteins, initiating the DNA repair pathway, maintaining chromosome stability, and ensuring the normal process of spermatogenesis.
Along with the increase in the prevalence of lipid metabolism disorders,in vitro research on the adipocytes has been a hot topic in recent years.
3T3-L1 preadipocyte line is one of the most commonly used cell line for establishing adipocytes models. However,for 3T3-L1 cell lines,the traditional method,known also as the "Cocktail" method,have disadvantages including low transformation rate and heterogeneous conversion.
Therefore,many studies aimed to improving the induction method by changing the time of inducers or adding other new drugs have been performed(known as the improved method).
The present study was to summarize the progress of the traditional methods and the improved methods for inducing 3T3-L1 cell lines to mature adipocytes.
With the rapid economic development in China, the incidence of all sorts of accidental injury, such as traffic injuries and fall-induced injuries, increased significantly.
Trauma, particularly severe trauma, often involves multiple organs and multiple system damage, and needs a scientific, standardized comprehensive multidisciplinary approach for treatment.
Due to meticulous sub-division of clinical department sand lack of professional trauma treatment team in general hospitals in China's major cities, the overall level of trauma rescue in China is much lower than the developed countries. So the urgent need is to establish and form an efficient and standardized urban trauma treatment system.
In order to further guarantee the establishment of urban trauma rescue system, and to further improve the success rate of trauma rescue in China, nationally well-known trauma experts of China developed the "Expert consensus document on the establishment of urban trauma rescue system in China" based on its previous research results, foreign countries' successful experience and China's national conditions. This document would be an important reference for our local governments at all levels to create urban trauma rescue system.
This study aimed to assess the nutritional status of infants aged 0 to 5 months by different feeding approaches. A cross-sectional study on infant nutrition was performed in eight cities in China.
A total of 622 infants from birth to 2 months of age and 456 infants from 3 months to 5 months of age were included in this study.
For artificially fed infants who received only complementary foods, approximately 20% and 12.5% infants received inadequate dietary vitamin A and zinc intakes, respectively.
The vitamin A and zinc intakes of half of the infants exceeded the ULs.
Results showed that the usual intake distribution of the infants from 3 months to 5 months of age were similar to that of the infants from birth to 2 months of age. The common vitamin A and zinc intakes were also severely imbalanced.
In addition, higher disease prevalence and lower Z scores of length-forage, weight-for-age, and weight-for-length were found in artificially fed infants and mix-fed infants compared with those in breast-fed infants.
In conclusion, the usual nutrient intakes were adequate for the majority of Chinese infants, except for an important number of infants at risk for imbalance of vitamin A and zinc intakes.
Cancer can exhibit different forms depending on the site of origin, cell types, the different forms of genetic mutations which also affect cancer therapeutic effect.
Although many genes have been demonstrated to change a direct result of the change in phenotype, however, many cancers lineage complex molecular mechanisms are still not fully elucidated.
Therefore, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network analyzed a large human tumors, in order to find the molecular changes in DNA, RNA, protein and epigenetic level, The results contain a wealth of data provides us with an opportunity for common, personality and new ideas throughout the cancer lineages form a whole description.
Pan-cancer genome program first compares the 12 kinds of cancer types.
Analysis of different tumor molecular changes and their functions, will tell us how effective treatment method is applied to a similar phenotype of the tumor.
A case of portopulmonary hypertension characterized by repeated syncope was retrospectively analyzed.
Intrahepatic or extrahepatic factor-induced portal hypertension complicated with metabolic disorder of vasoactive substances, vascular pressure, inflammation, etc. may result in systolic and diastolic dysfunction of pulmonary arteries and systemic hyperdynamic circulation, the long-term effect of which can induce vascular remodeling and consequently, pulmonary hypertension.
Currently available therapeutic approaches include drug therapy targeting on pulmonary hypertension and liver transplantation.
Hypertension is one of the most common chronic diseases affecting more than 25% of adults worldwide.
In Pakistan, 33% of the adult population suffers from hypertension.
Numerous epidemiological studies have demonstrated the critical role of dietary patterns in the causation, prevention and management of hypertension.
There's a dearth of evidence from South Asia in this regard.
The present study aimed to identify the association between dietary patterns and hypertension among 4304 low income urban adults who participated in the Control of Blood Pressure and Risk Attenuation (COBRA) study in Karachi, Pakistan.
Dietary information was collected by a 33- item food frequency questionnaire and 3 unique dietary patterns namely; fat and sweet, fruit and vegetable, and seafood and yogurt patterns were derived using principal component factor analyses.
We used univariate and multivariable logistic regression to examine the association between dietary patterns and hypertension.
Men were more likely to have hypertension, while increase in age, and body mass index were also associated with hypertension (p
Circle dance, which derives from the tradition of folk dances, is practised worldwide.
This article explores the meanings participants attribute to it.
In-depth interviews with 39 participants, teachers and coordinators of teacher training programmes from the circle dance network in the United Kingdom were undertaken.
This article specifically focuses on the first major category, termed "I can't imagine life without it", which relates to the experience of 22 dancers.
From an occupational perspective, the study reveals how participants realise a sense of meaning and satisfaction through engagement in circle dance and the potential contribution of this occupation to well-being.
To explore differences in visual information processing for smoking addicts between before and after smoking cessation based on functional magnetic resonance imaging technology.
Methods: Seventeen volunteers, with heavy dependence on nicotine, agreed to give up smoking and to complete the test.
The primary visual network and secondary visual network were extracted by independent component analysis technology.
The region of interest was defined as the region with significant difference between before and after smoking cessation. The functional connectivity analysis was carried out based on the selected region of interest.
Results: After the subjects quitting smoking for 14 days, the increased functional connectivity was observed not only within secondary visual network but also between 2 interested networks; however, no functional connectivity was changed within primary visual network.
Conclusion: The ability of visual information processing for smoking addicts could be significantly enhanced after 14 days of smoking cessation.
Liver cirrhosis is the severe period of chronic liver diseases, especially decompensated liver cirrhosis and its complications, such as ascites, esophagogastric variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, acute kidney injury, and hepatocellular carcinoma, which greatly affect patients' quality of life and even threaten their lives.
Early prevention and treatment of the causes of development and progression and pathogenic mechanism may slow down or reverse liver cirrhosis and its severe complications. Once the disease progresses to portal hypertension and related complications, it is very important to select preventive measures for acute exacerbation of different complications, as well as the methods and timing for treatment in acute stage, which may help to save patients' lives and improve their prognosis.
Acute agitation and aggression are common symptoms in patients with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.
In this review, we discuss the prevalence, clinical assessment strategies, treatment options, and current Western and Chinese guidelines for the management of acute agitation and aggression in patients with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia.
Among available approaches, we discuss in detail recent evidence supporting the use of intramuscular (IM) antipsychotics and some recently approved oral atypical antipsychotics for the management of acute aggression and agitation in hospitalized patients with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia presenting with acute agitation or aggression, highlighting some differences between individual antipsychotic agents.
To observe the clinical characteristics with different peritoneal transport type in patients with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), and to investigate the factors associated with peritoneal transport function.
Methods: The clinical data of 158 CAPD patients were analyzed retrospectively. According to peritoneal equilibration test, a method for evaluation of the peritoneal transport function, the patients were divided into 2 groups: a high average and high peritoneal transport group (Group A, n=84) and a low average and low peritoneal transport group (Group B, n=74). The demographics, clinical biochemical indexes and the incidence of cardiovascular complications were compared between the 2 groups. Logistic regression analysis was used to find the factors relevant to peritoneal transport function.
Results: The level of serum albumin (ALB) in the Group B was significantly higher than that in the Group A (P
Hyponatremia is a rare, yet potentially life threatening complication of antipsychotics.
Here, we report a case of a 45-year-old female diagnosed with schizophrenia who developed hyponatremia soon after addition of olanzapine to the existing treatment.
This prompted us to evaluate the relationship between hyponatremia and olanzapine, as timely management is crucial.
Naranjo algorithm established a "probable" causal relation between olanzapine and hyponatremia.
Possible etiological reasons of this clinically significant and life threatening adverse event have been discussed.
We report the case and the literature focusing on hyponatremia as a possible adverse event of olanzapine.
Medical illnesses are often ignored or missed in patients with psychiatric disorders either due to patients' inability to report complaints or non-serious attitude of physicians towards such patients.
A high index of suspicion should be kept while dealing with this probable complication.
Objective To study the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)that predict a patient's risk of grade 2-3 paclitaxel-induced peripheral sensory neuropathy (PSN) in Chinese Han populations.Methods Totally 216 patients received paclitaxel in Peking Union Medical College Hospital from May 2014 to December 2016 were enrolled.DNA was isolated from peripheral blood.Genotyping for eight candidate SNPs was performed on Sequenom-MassARRARYiPLEX platform.Patients were followed up and PSN was assessed by trained physicians according to National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.03.
Results A total of 209 patients entered the final analysis.Among the candidate SNPs,only rs4141404:A
Screening has been always considered as a double-edged sword.
Cancer screening could save lives in some cases, however, in other cases, it might also turn people into overdiagnosis.
Overdiagnosis is the diagnosis of cancer that will never cause symptoms or death during a patient's lifetime. Therefore, overdiagnosis might lead to unnecessary treatments and lifetime surveillance, and then increase economic burden and psychological burden.
After systematically reviewing the previous studies, we will try to identify the potential reasons associated with overdiagnosis in breast cancer screening with mammography, address how to correctly evaluate the overdiagnosis rate, and finally provide some suggestions to reduce the overdiagnosis.
