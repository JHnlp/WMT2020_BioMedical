Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a malignant tumour with quite high cancer specific mortality, and it still lacks stable and reliable markers for NSCLC's prognosis.
Platelet derived grow factor (PDGF) and PDGFR has been considered to be involved in the process of cell proliferation, migration, metastasis and epithelial mesenchymal transition of cancer cell through various intracellular signal pathways.
Pathology analysis showed that PDGF pathway mainly stimulates the proliferation of NSCLC tumour stroma through paracrine pattern, and some reaseach found that PDGF pathway directly promotes some NSCLC cell's proliferation.
The expression of PDGF and PDGFR within NSCLC tissue correlates with status of lymphatic metastasis and patients' prognosis.
In clinical treatment of NSCLC, the great effect of PDGF pathway in angiogenesis and promoting distribution of chemotherapy by inhibition of PDGF should not be neglected.
As an important pro-angiogenesis pathway, functions of PDGF in radiotherapy is dicovered by more and more fundamental research.
This review focuses on the progress of PDGF pathway in NSCLC and aims to provide some new ideas for clinical and fundamental researchers.
This paper reviews neuroimaging studies of depressive disorders conducted in Chinese populations since 2000.
Both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies using structural and functional imaging techniques have compared different types of depressed individuals, with and without specific genotypes, and the characteristics of depressed individuals before and after treatment with antidepressants.
Many of the findings are unstable - probably because most of the studies are underpowered - but there have been some important contributions to the international literature.
Future studies in China need to use standardized methods, longitudinal designs, and joint application of both structural and functional MRI.
Variation of plasma free amino acids (PFAAs) is an essential feature of protein metabolic abnormalities in cancer patients.
But there still little data about the cancer tissue free amino acid (TFAAs) profiles, including their patterns and correlations with PFAAs.
To evaluate the variation in PFAAs and cancer TFAAs in patients with lung cancer, including their patterns and correlations, we investigated the concentrations of free amino acids in lung cancer tissues (n=27), paired lung paracarcinomous tissues (n=27) and plasma (n=27) using an automatic amino acid analyzer after pre-treatment.
Within the PFAAs, the concentrations of five amino acids (tryptophan, glycine, citrulline, ornithine and proline) were significantly decreased, while that of phenylalanine was markedly increased compared with control subjects. Within the TFAAs, the concentrations of three amino acids (taurine, glutamic acid and glycine) were increased, while the concentrations of two amino acids (lysine and ornithine) were decreased significantly in lung cancer tissues compared with the paracarcinomous tissues.
The amino acid patterns in PFAAs and TFAAs had similar trends, but percentage variations were diverse.
Additionally, the concentrations of five amino acids (lysine, phenylalanine, threonine, serine, and alanine) in PFAAs correlated with those in lung cancer TFAAs, but no amino acids in PFAAs were correlated with those in lung paracarcinomous TFAAs.
Thus, PFAA profiles may reflect the status of cancer tissues, which may provide more information about the metabolic statuses and prognoses of patients with lung cancer.
Targeted drugs aimed at driver gene, such as Gefitinib, Erlotinib and Crizotinib, have an irreplaceable position in the therapy of advanced non-small cell lung cancer. These drugs bring benefit to patients, however, higher hepatotoxicity is also presented. Now, drug induced hepatotoxicity and its mechanism are reviewed.
At present, the treatment recommendations of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with clear epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene status has reached a consensus: patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC can give priority to epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), which can maximize the benefit from the treatment; while the patients with wild-type EGFR gene should regard chemotherapy as first choice whether the first-line or second-line therapy.
A large proportion of patients, however, have not received EGFR gene test for various reasons. In the paper, we will thoroughly review the related clinical trial from the point of view of evidence-based medicine, and suggest that the treatment of advanced NSCLC with unknown EGFR gene status should be distinguished according to their race and pathological characters in order to find out the patients who are most likely to benefit from EGFR-TKIs, and thus arrange the treatment sequence scientifically and rationally.
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide.
Despiting the great progress on target agents, majority of people who do not harbor a mutation could not get benefit from them.
Immunotherapy, through stimulating the body's immune system to improve the antitumor immunity effect, has been a new therapeutic method for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Study had been reported that immune checkpoint molecules, including programmed death-1 (PD-1)/PD-ligand (L) 1 axis, are closedly related with cancer generation and development, and play a key role on clinical significance of NSCLC.
Activation of PD-1/PD-L1 pathway contributes to tumor immune escape, and block PD-1/PD-L1 pathway can enhance endogenous antimuor immunity.
Currently increasing clinical trials suggested that immune checkpoint inhibitors, including anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies turned out to be beneficial and safe in NSCLC.
Here, we provide a review on the progress of PD-1/PD-L1 pathway and immune checkpoint inhibitors in NSCLC.
Intracellular nutrients and the rate of energy flowing in tumor cells are often higher than that in normal cells due to the prolonged stress of tumor-specific microenvironment. In this context, the metabolism of tumor cells provides the fuel of bio-synthesis and energy required for tumor metastasis.
Consistent with this, the abnormal metabolism such as extremely active glucose metabolism and excessive accumulating of fatty acid is also discovered in metastatic tumors.
Previous Studies have confirmed that the regulation of tumor metabolism can affect the tumor metastasis, and some of these have been successfully applied in clinical effective, positive way. Thus, targeting metabolism of tumor cells might be an effectively positive way to prevent the metastasis of tumor.
So, our review is focused on the research development of the relationship between tumor metabolism and metastasis as well as the underlying mechanism.
This paper addresses the need for diet assessment methods that capture the rapidly changing beverage consumption patterns in China.
The objective of this study was to develop a 3-day smartphone-assisted 24-hour recall to improve the quantification of beverage intake amongst young Chinese adults (n=110) and validate, in a small subset (n=34), the extent to which the written record and smartphone-assisted recalls adequately estimated total fluid intake, using 24-hour urine samples.
The smartphone-assisted method showed improved validity compared with the written record-assisted method, when comparing reported total fluid intake to total urine volume. However, participants reported consuming fewer beverages on the smartphone-assisted method compared with the written record-assisted method, primarily due to decreased consumption of traditional zero-energy beverages (i.e. water, tea) in the smartphone-assisted method.
Adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are the most common histological types of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Several molecular alterations have been defined as "driver oncogenes" responsible for both the initiation and maintenance of the malignancy.
With next-generation sequencing (NGS) which having multiple and high-throughput genotyping is wildly used and promoted, make the detection of patients gene composition from a tiny tumor biopsy specimens become possible, initiate the clinical studies based on the genetic characteristics, and promote the progress of molecular typing in NSCLC.
So far, about 60% of lung adenocarcinoma has been found harbouring driver oncogenes, the rate of lung squamous cell carcinoma driven genes detection has gradually improved, in which epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) and so on plays important roles. The currently effective targeted therapies is mainly used against EGFR, ALK, etc.
In this review, we will report the mainly advances on some latest driver mutations of NSCLC.
There is on-going controversy about the definition and sub-classification of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) that makes it difficult to assess the effectiveness of different proposed strategies for treating this chronic, often disabling condition.
Sub-classification of TRD in terms of symptom severity and in terms of demographic and clinical characteristics may help in the recognition of homogeneous TRD subgroups and in the development of subgroup-specific interventions.
The effects of patient characteristics on reported adherence to dietary self-care behaviours in 184 Taiwanese outpatients 40 years or older with type 2 diabetes was assessed.
Patient characteristics included the presence of predisposing factors affecting diabetes adherence (knowledge and attitudes about the disease, self-efficacy, and the absence of psychological problems), enabling factors (understanding of diabetes and environmental factors affecting it), and reinforcing factors (presence of medical and social support) which were evaluated using a 72 item self-administered questionnaire with 8 subscales.
Adherence was assessed by patients' reports of carrying out 7 self-care behaviours (following a diabetic meal plan, following the diabetes exchange system, eating meals providing the same amount of carbohydrate every day, counting carbohydrates, reducing dietary fat, consuming high fiber foods, and keeping a daily food record).
Reported adherence ranged from 17% to 74%.
No single predisposing, enabling, or reinforcing factor predicted adherence to all of the dietary self-care behaviours. However, more self-efficacy, better understanding, and a better attitude toward diabetes were associated with performing five or more of the dietary self-care behaviours examined.
With respect to specific self-care behaviours, women were more likely than men to count carbohydrates (OR=5.75) and reduce fat in their diets (OR=2.57). Patients who attended more nutrition education sessions were more likely to follow diabetes meal plans (OR=2.11) and the diabetes exchange system (OR=3.07).
Efforts are needed to encourage providers to teach diabetes self-care behaviours to patients and to capitalize upon demographic and psychosocial characteristics that can enhance patient adherence.
The aim of this study was to determine the level of exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and selected heavy metals among fishermen via dietary intake of fish and other seafood from the eastern coast along the Straits of Malacca.
This study determined the neurobehavioural performances (based on neurobehavioural core test battery scores) of the fishermen and evaluated the correlations between scores of neurobehavioural core test battery and exposure factors.
Ninety fishermen participated in the study.
The total fish intakes of the fishermen were measured using a set of food frequency questionnaires.
The PCBs contents in the seafood samples ranged between 0.2 and 0.6 pg/g fresh sample.
The concentrations of mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb) in the seafood samples were 1.1-5.4, 0.3-4.4, 0.6-36.1, and 0.02-0.3 μg/g fresh sample, respectively.
The PCBs, Hg, As, Cd, and Pb exposures of the fishermen was estimated to be 2.8, 0.02, 4.5, 0.09, and 0.5 pg/kg body weight/day, respectively.
PCB and heavy metal exposures through dietary intake of fish and seafood were within the tolerable daily limits.
The results of neurobehavioural core test battery revealed that the neurobehavioural performances of the fishermen were not affected due to PCB and heavy metal intoxication.
No correlations were found between the exposure and neurobehavioural performance among the fishermen. These data are useful for policy makers to assure the safety and quality of seafood in relation to sea pollution.
Although the levels of exposure were low, periodic assessment of the quality of fish and fish products is required due to the polluted seawater.
Seven eligible randomized controlled trials with 513 subjects were identified.
The objective of this study was to identify correlates of household food insecurity and poor dietary diversity in rural Cambodia.
Trained interviewers administered a survey to 900 households in four rural districts of Prey Veng Province, Cambodia.
The Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) and Household Dietary Diversity Score (HDDS) were used to assess household food insecurity and dietary diversity.
Multivariate logistic regression models were constructed to identify independent correlates of household food insecurity and poor dietary diversity (HDDS
Lactose is the main carbohydrate in infant feeding, but its impact decreases as the child gets older and consumes less milk and dairy products.
Congenital lactose intolerance is a very rare condition.
However, lactase activity may be low and need to mature during the first weeks of life in many infants.
However, the evidence that unabsorbed lactose is causing infantile crying and colic is contradictory.
Unabsorbed lactose has a bifidogenic effect and improves calcium absorption.
Lactose malabsorption may occur secondary and thus temporally to other etiologies such as infectious gastroenteritis, cow's milk allergy and celiac disease.
One the cause is treated, lactase activity will gradually return to normal.
The vast majority of Asian children will develop late onset congenital lactase deficiency.
However, this entity only exceptionally causes symptoms before the age of 4-5 years.
Symptoms are abdominal cramps, flatulence and watery, acid stools, and decrease the quality of life but lactose intolerance is not associated with "true disease".
The diagnosis is made on clinical grounds and confirmed with a lactose breath test, if needed.
These patients need to have a lifetime long reduced lactose intake to improve their quality of life.
The strong social pressure for thinness in Japanese society has produced a dramatic increase in underweight (body mass index:
The aim of our study was to examine the association of vitamin A status with obesity and the metabolic syndrome (MS) in school-age children in Chongqing, China.
A cross-sectional study was conducted of 1,928 children aged 7~11 years from 5 schools in Chongqing, China.
Body height, weight, waist circumference (WC) and blood pressure were measured. Blood glucose, lipids and vitamin A were determined.
Overall prevalences for overweight, obesity and MS were 10.1%, 6.7% and 3.5%, respectively. There were 274 (14.2%) marginally vitamin A deficient (MVAD) children and 53 (2.8%) vitamin A deficient (VAD) children, respectively.
Serum vitamin A in the obese group was significantly lower than in the overweight and normal weight groups (p
Inulin-based prebiotics are non-digestible polysaccharides that influence the composition of the gut microbiota in infants and children, notably eliciting a bifidogenic effect with high short chain fatty acid levels.
Inulin, a generic term that comprises β-(2,1)-linked linear fructans, is typically isolated from the chicory plant root, and derivatives such as oligofructose and long chain inulin appear to have different physiological properties.
The first 1000 days of a child's life are increasingly recognized as a critical timeframe for health also into adulthood, whereby nutrition plays a key role.
There is an ever increasing association between nutrition and gut microbiota composition and development, with life health status of an individual.
This review summarizes the latest knowledge in the infant gut microbiota from preterms to healthy newborns, as well as in malnourished children in developing countries.
The impact of inulin or mixtures thereof on infants, toddlers and young children with respect to intestinal function and immunity in general, is reviewed.
Possible benefits of prebiotics to support the gut microbiome of malnourished infants and children, especially those with infections in the developing world, are considered, as well as for the pregnant mothers health.
Importantly, novel insights in metabolic programming are covered, which are being increasing recognized for remarkable impact on long term offspring health, and eventual potential beneficial role of prebiotic inulins.
Overall increasing findings prompt the potential for gut microbiota-based therapy to support health or prevent the development of certain diseases from conception to adulthood where inulin prebiotics may play a role.
Understanding and treatment strategy for disc displacement of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) were discussed in the present review.
It has been strongly recommended by the author that the treatment strategy for disc displacement, one subtype of TMD, should be mainly the reversible conservative treatment methods.
The most important goal of treatment for disc displacement is to recover the mobility and function of the joint in order to improve the quality of the patient's life.
Comprehensive assessments both from somatic and psychological aspects for each TMD patient are necessary, especially for the patients with chronic pain.
Although the role of surgical operative treatments is very limited in the general treatment strategy for TMD, it is still important for a few patients who had definite diagnosis of intra-articular disorders, severe symptoms affecting the quality of patient's life and failed to response to the correct conservative treatments.
It should be very careful to treat the TMD patients by surgical operation or irreversible occlusion treatments changing the natural denture of the patient, such as full mouth occlusional reconstruction and extensive adjustment of occlusion.
A new clinic conception, healthy cosmetic management (HCM), was innovated introduced into diagnose and treatment of patients with high caries risk.
The priority of HCM should be given to aesthetic restoration of teeth, taking consideration of the conserving of tissue and pulp of teeth and the balance between health and aesthetics, which may reach to the goal of the individual clinic treatment.
HCM includes five steps: 1) caries risk assessment; 2) detection of initial caries; 3) digital aesthetic design; 4) minimally invasive therapy; 5) behavior management of caries and doctor-patient communication pattern.
In this article, HCM is introduced into two aspects: process management and clinical protocols, followed by the combination of the clinical practice.
Aortic arch reconstruction is one of the most challenging operations in aortic surgery.
Anatomical abnormalities of the aortic arch, including bovine aortic arch, aberrant right subclavian artery, and single vertebral artery have direct impact on the choice of surgical procedures and methods of brain protection.The risk of aortic arch reconstruction and the difficulty of operation, it is possible to avoid the injury of patients by strictly grasping the indication of operation.
Intraoperative arterial cannulation and brain protection strategies are directly related to the success of the operation.
This article makes a brief review of the above problems in the reconstruction of the aortic arch, hoping to be helpful to the cardiovascular surgeon.
To investigate the effect of nucleolin on cardiac cell apoptosis in Type 2 diabetic cardiomyopathy mice.
Methods: Mice were fed with high-fat and high-sugar food for 20 weeks (mice were injected intraperitoneally with 60 mg/kg streptozotocin in the 5th and 6th weeks) to establish a mouse model of Type 2 diabetes. The mice were divided into 4 groups: a wild type (WT) control group, a nucleolin transgenic (TG) control group, a WT diabetic group, a TG diabetic group. Diabetes-related indicators were detected at the end of the 8th week. At the end of the 20th week, HE staining was used to observe myocardial morphological changes; TUNEL staining and caspase-3 activity were used to detect the extent of apoptosis of cardiac myocytes.
Results: The level of fasting blood glucose was significantly increased in the diabetic group than that in the control group. In WT diabetic group, myocardial disarrangement, fragmentation and dissolution were observed (determined by HE staining); cellular apoptosis (determined by TUNEL staining and caspase-3 activity) also increased markedly in the WT diabetic group.
Compared with the wild mice in the diabetic group, myocardial morphological changes and cardiac myocytes apoptosis were alleviated significantly.
Conclusion: Nucleolin overexpression affectes the occurrence and development of diabetic cardiomyopathy through inhibition of cardiac myocyte apoptosis.
To investigate effects of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) on inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in kidneys of Type 1 diabetic rats.
Methods: Thirty-two male SD rats were randomly divided into four groups: A normal control (NC) group, a diabetes mellitus (DM) group, a NaHS (NaHS+DM) group, and a NaHS control (NaHS) group (n=8 per group).
Type 1 diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (55 mg/kg).
After successful establishment of models, the rats in NaHS+DM and NaHS groups were injected with NaHS solution (56 μmol/kg) intraperitoneally.
Eight weeks later, the activities of total nitric oxide synthase (T-NOS) and iNOS, as well as the level of nitric oxide (NO) were detected in serum and renal tissues, respectively. The activity of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) was determined in renal tissues. The ultrastructures of renal tissues were observed by transmission electron microscope. The protein expression of iNOS in renal tissues was detected by Western blot.
Results: Compared with the NC group, there was no significant difference in the various indexes in the NaHS group (P
The present case report described a 61-year-old female patient who was diagnosed as Meige syndrome with double eyelid spasm, anxiety and insomnia. After she was treated with psychoactive drugs, it was found that clonazepam tablets in the benzodiazepine class and dopamine antagonist olanzapine tablets aggravated double eyelid spasm; while eszopiclone tablets as a specificity γ-aminobutyric acid receptor binding drug alleviated this condition.
The present case suggests that psychoactive drugs have both positive and negative effects on treating Meige syndrome. As for the patients who also have emotion disorder, their conditions should be observed carefully when choosing which psychoactive drug to use. The specificity γ-aminobutyric acid receptor binding drugs should be the prime choice, such as eszopiclone.
Laparoscopic surgery has been increasingly used in rectal cancer surgery.
Though there are still some controversies, most of the research results support that the outcome is similar for rectal cancer patients with either laparoscopic or open surgery, in term of short-term such as safety and efficacy and long-term such as oncologic outcome.
Standardization of laparoscopic training together with the comprehensive management concept are the prerequisites of laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery.
Those doctors who do minimally invasive surgery should follow the rationale that smaller incision and sphincter preservation are secondary to safety and oncological result of the patients.
It is the comprehensive management and personalized treatment that bring opportunities for the continuous development and innovation of innovative technologies and concepts, for example, non-operative treatment, endoscopic therapy, natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery, single incision laparoscopic surgery, and robotic surgery. And they may finally lead to better outcome and quality of life for the patients.
Evaluation of the vaginal bleeding of postmenopausal women is crucial to diagnose endometrial lesions. Endometrial thickness measured by transvaginal ultrasonography provides an important reference for diagnosis.
Currently, no specific cut-off value of endometrial thickness has been identified to predict the malignant risk for endometrial thickening and postmenopausal women without any symptoms.
Most of resected endometrial specimens from postmenopausal women without any symptoms are diagnosed as benign or normal tissues.
It seems that postmenopausal women without any symptoms have no need for general screen or intervention of endometrial cancer.
The European Association for the Study of the Liver recently released the updated Clinical Practice Guidelines on the management of hepatitis B virus infection at the International Liver Congress(TM) 2017 in Amsterdam.
The latest clinical practice guideline integrated the latest scientific advances on diagnosis and therapy of hepatitis B, thereby providing optimize the management of patients with either acute or chronic HBV.
The latest clinical practice guideline includes new definitions of disease phases, expanded indications for initiating treatment, prevention of mother-to-child transmission, new stopping rules for antiviral therapy. Future treatment strategies to achieve 'cure' of disease and new biomarkers are discussed.
Epistaxis or nasal bleeding is a common condition which may be severe enough to warrant an urgent medical or surgical treatment.
Factitious epistaxis is a rare entity.
Due to a lack of exposure in complex behavioral issues during undergraduate training, it is quite natural on the part of a surgeon to miss the underlying emotional phenomena. Here, we present a case of factitious disorder which presented to the surgical causality with nasal bleeding.
After proper evaluation and liaison with the department of otorhinolaryngology, we were able to manage the patient with antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy.
To investigate the relationship between social support and depression of only-child-lost (OCL) people, and the mediation role of self-efficacy in this relationship.
Methods: By stratified cluster sampling, 214 OCL people were enrolled, with 80 males and 134 females, ages from 49 to 83 years old. They were assessed by General Self-Efficacy Scale, Social Support Rating Scale, and Self-rating Depression Scale.
Results: Univariate analysis showed that there were significant differences in age groups (t=2.85, P
A 29-year-old male patient with extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, a nasal type lymphoma with involvement of skin as the first symptom, was reported. The patient presented with swelling in the left side of the nose and suffered intermittent fever for 1 month. The fester in the oral mucosa and skin under the left nostril and redness, and the swelling on the orbit of the left eye lasted for 1 week.
Physical examination showed that the left side of nose was swelling, and the skin below the left nostril was anabrotic and crusted.
There were different ulcers in his jaws and buccal mucosa.
Bilateral eyelid was redness and swelling, especially in the left side. Binocular conjunctival was congestive. The diagnosis of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (nasal type) was confirmed by biopsy and immunohistochemistry.
The cyclic dinucleotide c-di-GMP is known as an important second messenger in bacteria, which controls various important cellular processes, such as cell differentiation, biofilm formation and virulence factors production.
It is extremely vital for the development of new antibacterial agents by virtue of blocking c-di-GMP signal conduction.
Current research indicates that there are three potential targets for discovering new antibacterial agents based on c-di-GMP regulated signal pathway, which are c-di-GMP synthases, c-di-GMP degrading enzymes and c-di-GMP receptors.
Herein, we review small molecules that have been developed to inhibit c-di-GMP related enzymes and indicate perspectives of c-di-GMP inhibitors.
Thyroid dysfunction may affect the body growth metabolism and the synthesis and secretion of sex steroids. A large number of clinical and basic studies suggest that thyroid hormone abnormality can cause sexual and reproductive problems.
Patients with hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism may develop not only premature ejaculation but also erectile dysfunction. The thyroid hormone level also influences Leydig cells, Sertoli cells, and spermatogenesis.
This review focuses on the association of thyroid dysfunction with male premature ejaculation, erectile dysfunction, and infertility and its mechanisms.
Naïve CD4+T cell differentiates into either Th17 or Treg in the microenvironment of various cytokines, among that, Th17 is induced by TGF-β and IL-6, while differentiates into Treg when there is only TGF-β.
As the mainly transcription factors of Th17 and Treg respectively, RORγt and Foxp3 have important role in maintaining balance of Th17/Treg.
Th17 and Treg are function antagonistically, so the balance of Th17/Treg means a lot for human body.
Liver-a metabolic organof the body, it is susceptible to factors in vivo and in vitro. From basal hepatis to end-stage malignancy, common liver diseases are mainly including viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, autoimmune liver disease, hepatocellualr carcinoma and parasitic disease of liver, besides, the occurrence and development of all the diseases are correlated to the balance of Th17/Treg.
The development of genome editing techniques based on CRISPR (Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-Cas9 system has revolutionized biomedical researches.
It can be utilized to edit genome sequence in almost any organisms including Caenorhabditis elegans, one of the most convenient and classic genetic model animals. The application of CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome editing in C. elegans promotes the functional analysis of gene and proteins under many physiological conditions.
In this mini-review, we summarized the development of CRISPR-Cas9-based genome editing in C. elegans.
Translation control in eukaryotes contributes significantly to gene expression regulation during cellular processes, which enables rapid changes of specific proteins to maintain cellular homeostasis.
Eukaryotic translation is a multiple-step process that comprised of four phases: initiation, elongation, termination and ribosome recycling. The initiation phase is rate-limiting and orchestrated by a set of eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs).
Defects in translation initiation can result in a series of diseases.
Among all eIFs, eIF3 is the largest and less-known initiation factor due to its intrinsic complexity.
Aberration in eIF3A, the largest subunit of eIF3, is known to contribute to carcinogenesis and protection against evolution into higher-grade malignancy, and the altered expression or mutation of eIF3A affects the responses of cancer patients to platinum-based chemotherapy.
Besides its role in cancinogenesis, eIF3A is also implicated in fibrosis, and the agents inhibiting eIF3A delay the progression of this disorder.
The dual roles of eIF3A in tumorigenesis are probably due to the regulation of translation of different mRNAs at different stages of tumor progression by eIF3A. In turn the encoded products serve as pro-tumor or anti-tumor proteins at different stages.
HINT1 protein is expressed in various tissues and plays an important role in transcription and signal transduction.
Earlier studies have identified HINT1 as a haplo-insufficient tumor suppressor. Other evidences indicate that HINT1 is involved in a wide variety of physiological processes,some of which are irrelevant with its basic enzymic activities. Investigations recently suggest that HINT1 is closely related to many peripheral and central nervous system diseases,and plays a vital role in some of neuropsychiatric diseases such as inherited peripheral neuropathies,schizophrenia,mood disorder,drug addiction,and Down's syndrome.
In this review,the role of HINT1 in above-mentioned neuropsychiatric disorders was summarised,and the research findings of HINT1 in each of the above diseases were summarized and analyzed,in order to provide some guidance for further research on this protein.
Minimally invasive esophagectomy has recently become popular after the laparoscopic technique was developed.
However, the postoperative energy expenditure in patients undergoing this procedure has not been evaluated.
Therefore, we hypothesized that postoperative resting energy expenditure (REE) following minimally invasive esophagectomy is lower than that estimated using the Harris-Benedict equation.
Fifteen patients who underwent esophagectomy by thoracoscopy in the prone position were analyzed.
After esophagectomy, an indirect calorimeter measured the energy expenditure during ventilation in the ICU.
These values and the estimated basal energy expenditure values were compared using the paired t test.
The mean age was 66 ± 10 years and mean duration of ventilator use in the ICU was 697 ± 70 mins.
The acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores at the time of ICU admission were 13 ± 4 and 2 ± 1, respectively.
The average temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate during ventilation were 36.2 ± 0.6°C, 67 ± 9 beats/min, and 12 ± 2/min, respectively. The average REE during ventilation was 985 ± 167 kcal/day (18.1 ± 3.4 kcal/kg/day).
The estimated REE was 1191 ± 159 kcal/day.
The average REE measured using the indirect calorimeter during ventilation was significantly lower than the estimated REE (83 ± 10% of the estimated REE, p
Recently, the incidence and detection rates of multiple primary lung cancer (MPLC) are increasing.
The diagnosis of MPLC depends mainly on the Martini-Melamed criterion and ACCP criterion at present, taking all features (histological, genetic, radiologic and clinical) into account.
It may be easy to diagnose cases of MPLC that exhibit different histological types, but it is difficult to diagnose cases that exhibit similar histological type.
The currently adopted staging system for lung cancer is the seventh edition of the TNM staging edited by Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) in January, 2009.
In recent years, with the advances of techniques in lung cancer diagnosis and the treatment trends towards precision treatment modalities such as individualized therapy and molecular targeted therapy, the survival and prognosis of lung cancer has been significantly improved. The old staging standard is difficult to satisfy the currentrapidly developing clinical needs.
Therefore, the International Lung Cancer Research Society (International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, IASLC) updated the stage of lung cancer in 2015, and the forthcoming eighth edition of the TNM Classification for Lung Cancer, which will be formally adopted in Jan. 2017, has been published in Journal of Thoracic Oncology.
The new staging system has adopted 35 databases from 16 countries, including 94,708 cases treated between 1999 and 2010.
The advantages of the new staging lies in its higher prognosis prediction and clinical guidance value.
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality currently. Early diagnosis is crucial to the good prognosis of lung cancer.
Evidence has shown that low-dose computed tomography (CT) screening can make the decline in the mortality of lung cancer.
However, there are still many problems in the screening, such as, high false-positive rates, overdiagnosis and radiation exposure.
As another non-invasive tumor screening method, blood-based tumor markers showed a high sensitivity and specificity in early diagnosis of lung cancer in recent years.
How to establish a comprehensive mode for lung cancer screening by use existing screening methods, we need more clinical research.
The root and canal anatomy of maxillary first molar is very complicated. The incidence of having two canals in the mesiobuccal root of maxillary first molar is higher than that in its distobuccal root.
This article described a maxillary first molar with five root canals, including two canals in mesiobuccal and distobuccal roots.
To investigate the effects of dexmedetomidine on perioperative cardiac adverse events in elderly patients with coronary heart disease.
Methods: Sixty elderly patients, who were diagnosed as coronary heart disease and underwent gastric cancer operation, were randomly divided into 2 groups (n=30): the dexmedetomidine group (Dex group) and the control group.
In the Dex group, dexmedetomidine was administered intravenously at 0.5 μg/(kg·h) after a bolus infusion at 0.5 μg/kg for 10 min before anesthesia induction. In the control group, equal volume of normal saline was infused instead of dexmedetomidine. The 2 groups received the same anesthesia treatment.
Objective The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship between periodontitis and hyperlipidemia risks through Meta-analysis.
Methods Two researchers conducted an electronic search on PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, CBM, CNKI, Wanfang and VIP databases established until July 2016 for observational studies on the association between periodontitis and hyperlipidemia. The language used was limited to Chinese and English. After data extraction and quality evaluation of included trials, Meta-analysis was conducted using the RevMan 5.3 software. The GRADE 3.6 software was used to evaluate the quality level of the evidence.
Results Six case-control studies and one cohort study were included.
The results of Meta-analysis showed that serum triglyceride (TG) in patients with periodontitis was significantly higher than that of the periodontal health group (MD=50.50, 95% confidence interval=39.57-61.42, P
We review the origin of circulating lncRNAs, and the detection methods as potential biomarkers. We focus on the early diagnosis value of circulating lncRNAs as tumor biomarkers in lung, breast, gastric, liver, colorectal and prostate cancers.
Compared with the traditional biomarkers, the circulating lncRNAs show the unique advantages and clinical values as novel biomarkers.
Lung cancer is a common malignant tumor in clinic. Morbidity and mortality are the first place in cancer, which seriously threaten the health of human beings.
Due to the lack of effective and specific screening methods, most patients were found already at an advanced stage, and often combined with bone, brain, liver, adrenal and other parts of the metastasis.
Symptoms of patient resulted from the primary tumor, metastatic spread, or paraneoplastic syndrome commonly cause the medical attention.
For the syndrome related to the distant metastatic spread as the first manifestation, diagnosis would be a challenge.
Retinal metastasis is very rare as the first symptom of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.
This paper reviewed a case, in which a patient developed the retinal metastasis as the inital presentation. After systemic evaluation, our patient was managed in multidisciplinary treatments, including surgery and chemotherapy. Now, the patient has a good short-term prognosis and is still in fellow-up condition.
At the same time, reviewing the relevant literature on tumor metastasis provides a window for our understanding of the rare manifestations of lung cancer.
Production of bioenergy and bio-based chemicals by using fermentable sugars released from low-cost renewable lignocellulosic biomass has received great attention.
Efficient cellulolytic enzymes are crucial for lignocellulose bioconversion, but high cellulase production cost is limiting the bioconversion efficiency of cellulosic biomass and industrial applications of lignocellulose biorefinery.
Studies on induction and regulation of cellulase in filamentous fungi will help to further develop superior fungal strains for efficient cellulase production and reduce cellulase production cost.
With the advances in high-throughput sequencing and gene manipulation technology using fungal strains, an in-depth understanding of cellulase induction and regulation mechanisms of enzyme expression has been achieved.
